{"title": "Report: we barely use Gen AI but businesses are hyped and eager to dive in", "published_date": "04 June 2024 ", "description": "New surveys keep telling us that the hype is real and that more and more organizations worldwide are successfully adopting generative AI. This time, it’s McKinsey, a management consultancy.  According to McKinsey and its latest Global Survey, generative AI adoption is accelerating and companies are already reporting “measurable benefits and increased mitigation of the risk of inaccuracy.”  Nearly two-thirds of respondents said their organizations were regularly using Gen AI – twice as much as about ten months ago. Expectations have also stayed high, with three-quarters predicting that Gen AI will lead to “significant or disruptive change” in their industries.    What’s more, the material benefits from Gen AI use already exist for some – costs have allegedly decreased and revenues have jumped. Marketing and sales organizations seem to be generating most value from the use of Gen AI.   Finally, compared to 2023, respondents are even more likely to be using Gen AI in their personal lives. Twenty-six percent  said  they were regularly using the technology both at work and outside of it, and the greatest upticks were found in Asia-Pacific and Greater China regions.  “The technology’s potential is no longer in question. And while most organizations are still in the early stages of their journeys with gen AI, we are beginning to get a picture of what works and what doesn’t in implementing – and generating actual value with – the technology,” said Alex Singla, senior partner at QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey.  Now, hang on a minute. If it’s all so rosy and beautiful and AI is dramatically changing the world, why then, according to another detailed study, most people have never even heard of it?  A few days ago, a study from the Reuters institute and Oxford University revealed that even among the people who have tried out tools like ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot, a large majority only played with them once or twice.  Twelve thousand people in six countries were  surveyed , and in the United Kingdom, only 2% of respondents said they used Gen AI tools on a daily basis. Up to 30% of respondents  don’t even know  about ChatGPT.  Of course, all surveys have their limitations. In this case, people were asked about standalone Gen AI tools rather than examples when technology is smoothly integrated into existing products.  Still, it’s clear that Gen AI tools are pretty far from becoming a default part of our lives – hype does not necessarily equal public interest. With businesses, though, it’s different – their bottom line is making more money, and if Gen AI tools help then they will definitely be used.

The breach allegedly affects 30 million customers from Spain, Chile, and Uruguay.  Santander is the largest banking group in Spain by a considerable margin and one of the world’s best-known financial services groups.  ShinyHunters claims to have the records of 30 million customers, six million account numbers and balances, 28 million credit card numbers, HR employee lists, consumer citizenship information, and “much more.”    The data is being offered for a price of $2 million as a one-time sale.  “Santander is also very welcome if they want to buy this data,” the threat actor’s post reads.  The bank previously acknowledged that it’s aware of unauthorized access to the database hosted by a third-party provider.  “It has affected clients of Santander Chile, Spain, and Uruguay as well as employees of the institution,” Santander  confirmed  on May 14th, 2024.

The bank also “has activated its protocols to manage these cases, blocking access to the information that was irregularly accessed.”  “The bank's operations and systems, meanwhile, have not been affected and are functioning normally,” Santander said and warned to be alert customers to be aware of phishing schemes.    That’s the second huge data trove ShinyHunters has put for sale on the recently rebooted illicit marketplace  BreachForums . Earlier this week, they announced a bargain price of $500,000 for the alleged  customer dataset  of 560 million Ticketmaster users.  ShinyHunters has a track record of multiple high-profile data breaches that have cost their victims, including Microsoft, Mashable, and Pluto TV, tens of millions of dollars.

{"title": "Hackers claim Ticketmaster in attempt to boost revived forum’s popularity", "published_date": "29 May 2024 ", "description": "ShinyHunters cybercrime ring, which is rebooting the infamous illicit marketplace BreachForums after its seizure by the FBI, has posted claims about a very large breach affecting Ticketmaster. However, some analysts speculate that the alleged sale of 560 million customers' data may be a PR stunt.  Ticketmaster is a ticket sales and distribution company that merged with Live Nation, forming the world's largest live entertainment conglomerate. It handles live concerts and shows.  ShinyHunters’ post on the rebooted forum claims they have the full details of 560 million customers, including name, address, email, and phone number, combined with details from ticket sales, event information, and other sources. Credit card details supposedly include the last four digits of a card and an expiration date.    And there is “much more” in the data set, which hackers are selling for $500,000 and for one buyer only.  The provided screenshots indicate the data set of 15 folders is 1.3 Terabytes-large. Most of the folder names start with “sales_ord_deluxe_hdr.” Another screenshot is a sample of personal data.  Open-source intelligence researcher CyberKnow warns that this post may be a trick to boost attention to the illicit forum BreachForums reboot, as the leak contains “some questionable aspects.”  “Shinyhunters, who has claimed the sizable breach, has an interest in quickly rebuilding the userbase and reputation of BreachForums, which is where they have posted the claim. We have seen in the past that admins of forums will make big attention-grabbing claims to build up user bases quickly,” CyberKnow posted on X.  After reviewing the provided sample, the researcher concluded that there are 54 email addresses, and none of them are linked to current dates – they’re all from 2018 and older.  “The emails look like a mix of UK and US-linked email addresses. The new data from 2023/2024 looks like information related to ticket sales information and does not include any personal information,” CyberKnow shared. “While there is some new data in the shared evidence, there is also old customer information, making it possible this is a series of data jammed together.”  🚨🚨Thoughts on the alleged Ticketmaster Data Breach 🚨🚨 TLDR: Alert not Alarmed The Ticketmaster data breach claim has provided BreachForums with the quick attention they need to boost their user numbers and reputation.  The claim has possibly been over-stated to boost…  pic.twitter.com/WJsFkBfQbw undefined CyberKnow (@Cyberknow20)  May 29, 2024    At this stage, analysts cannot confirm or deny the legitimacy of ShinyHunters’ claims. If true, it would be another blow to Live Nation-Ticketmaster, after the US Department of Justice  announced  last week that it's suing the entertainment behemoth over weaponizing and entranching its power at the expense of artists and music fans.    ShinyHunters also talked to journalists from Hackread.com and Databreaches.net, claiming they had attempted to contact Ticketmaster regarding the breach to no avail. The malicious actor didn’t answer questions about how Ticketmaster was allegedly compromised.  Cybernews has reached out to Ticketmaster for a comment and is awaiting their response.  ShinyHunters (also known as ShinyCorp) is an international cyber threat group that first emerged in 2020, according to SOCRadar. It’s believed to be responsible for a leaked AT&T database containing over 70 million customer records.  The FBI recently hit ShinyHunters, the alleged perpetrators of BreachForums. The site was taken down, and the administrator,  Baphomet , was allegedly arrested. However, not long after, hackers reclaimed the site.  The FBI is investigating these criminal hacking forums.

AD learned that a malicious actor had accessed its systems and left a ransom note on its network.   On April 10th, 2024, the dermatologist center determined that between March 2nd and March 5th, 2024, the actor had gained access to the systems and copied data from AD’s network. The data obtained relates to the PII of both employees and patients.     The impacted data includes:    Names  Dates of birth  Addresses  Social Security numbers  Patient medical treatment information  Patient health insurance claims information  Employee driver’s license numbers  Employee passport numbers   “The information involved varies for each individual, and not every category applies in each individual case,” the healthcare provider said.   As reported on the Office of the Maine Attorney's website, the ransomware attack has affected approximately 370,000 people.  After the incident, AD claims to have taken steps to disconnect access to its network and employed cybersecurity specialists to help with restoration to its systems.   AD is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to anyone affected by the ransomware attack.   Affiliated Dermatologists and Dermatologic Surgeons is a dermatologic care service that works in various areas across the US.   The ransomware group BianLian claimed the attack on Affiliated Dermatologist in April of 2024.     BianLian has targeted organizations in multiple US critical infrastructure sectors since June 2022.  The gang has also targeted critical sectors in Australia, according to the US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  The threat actors of unknown origin typically gain access to victims through the use of valid Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, according to a ransomware advisory alert about the gang released by CISA this past spring.  The phrase Bian Lian, or “face-changing” in Chinese, is an ancient performance art known as Chinese Sichuan opera, which uses colorful costumes and masks. It’s rarely seen outside the mainland due to protected secrecy law.  According to  Ransomlooker , a Cybernews ransomware monitoring tool, BianLian has targeted 196 organizations in the last 12 months.

{"title": "Latvia could criminalize deepfakes that target politicians", "published_date": "22 May 2024 ", "description": "Latvia’s president has proposed making the use of deepfakes against politicians a punishable offense of up to five years in prison.   President Edgars Rinkēvičs said in a letter addressed to Latvian lawmakers that they had the responsibility to protect the country’s politics from the “undue influence” of deepfake technologies.  The use of deepfakes to discredit candidates for important state roles could cause “significant or even irreversible damage” to the interests of the Latvian state, Rinkēvičs said in the letter to the Legal Commission of the Saeima, Latvia’s parliament.     According to Latvia's public broadcaster LSM, the Saeima will have to amend the country’s Criminal Code to outlaw the use of deepfakes against politicians, which could be challenging.   “The proposals have some way to go before becoming law, and Saeima will have to wrestle with several tricky tasks, not least of which will be defining exactly what constitutes ‘deepfake’ content and malicious intent with regard to its use,” the  broadcaster  said.   It also noted the proposal was “notably limited” in that it aims to protect only individuals in the political, parliamentary, or administrative spheres who are appointed by the Saeima.   While Latvian citizens elect the Saeima in a national vote, the president is elected by the parliament, which also appoints and confirms other high-ranking officials.   The president suggested that the punishment for “influencing the process of confirmation in the Saeima by using deepfake technology” should be up to five years in jail.   Earlier in May, the Latvian Saeima  criminalized  attempts to influence election results using deepfake technology. The bill's authors said deepfakes posed a threat to fair and free elections.  Elsewhere in Europe, England and Wales moved to criminalize the creation of sexually explicit deepfake images of adults in April. The  new legislation  means that anyone creating sexually explicit deepfakes without consent will face a criminal record and an unlimited fine.   This will apply regardless of whether the image was intended to be shared or not. And if the image is shared more widely, the offender may face prison time, according to the Ministry of Justice. Similar protections concerning children under the age of 18 are already in place.

{"title": "Chrome extensions considerably reduce browsing speeds – unless it’s an adblocker", "published_date": "20 May 2024 ", "description": "Chrome extensions are adding significant CPU processing time and memory usage. A single extension could delay website load time by more than a second, with each quickly adding up. However, adblockers do the opposite and actually speed up the device.  DebugBear, a site speed monitoring service, analyzed the impact of 5,000 Chrome extensions, 366 of which had over a million users.  On a simple test site, at least 11 of the most popular extensions caused slowdowns of more than 0.5 seconds.    “We find that several add over half a second of additional processing time to every page view. Monica, an AI tool with 2 million users, adds 1.3 seconds of processing time even on a simple test website. The Read&Write extension, with 17 million users, adds 0.8 seconds of processing time,” Matt Zeunert, the report's author, said.    Image by debugbear.com.   The researchers noticed that different extensions exhibited varying performance across different websites. For example, on shopping websites, tools like Klarna, Honey, and Capital One Shopping cause the most significant slowdowns, often exceeding two seconds.  When adding less popular extensions to the test, delays of two or more seconds are becoming more common.  “We can see that the MaxAI chrome extension with 800,000 users adds 2.3 seconds of processing time to every page visit. Other AI tools like eJOY AI, Magical, and QuestionAI also all add over one second of CPU time,”  the report  reads.  Most of the processor cycles are used by extensions to run the JavaScript code.  However, most of the analyzed extensions (86.3%) slowed the test website by below 50ms.  After the page loads, interaction delays due to Chrome extensions are less common. The researcher discovered that the Avira Password Manager extension added a 160ms delay when clicking on a random content heading, while other extensions contributed significantly less.    “While most extensions have a minimal performance impact, there are also many widely used extensions that slow down pages significantly. This effect is additive between extensions, so installing ten moderately fast Chrome extensions can still lead to a noticeable slowdown in your browsing experience. The performance impact of Chrome extensions will also be more noticeable on lower-end devices,” Zeunert concluded.  Ad blockers speed up browsing While most extensions add functionality to websites and cause delays, some extensions, adblockers, and privacy tools remove features such as ad banners, leading to significant speedups.  “To measure this, we tested two news articles with different adblockers installed. Across both pages, we found 57 seconds of CPU processing time without an adblocker installed. If we install uBlock Origin, one of the most popular adblockers with 37 million users, processing time goes down to just under four seconds,” the report notes.  Not all ad blockers are equal. Two of the most popular, AdBlock and AdBlock Plus, didn’t save more than about 15% of overall processing time.  Blocking all scripts can save the most processing time at the cost of losing webpage functionality.    Image by debugbear.com.   Loading less content also means using less device memory. uBlock Origin reduced the weight of tested ad-heavy news web pages from 41 megabytes to just under three megabytes.  “ We find that, on ad-heavy websites, memory consumption still goes down significantly with most adblockers. ”  Among the top 5,000 extensions, 27 use over 100 megabytes of storage space. The record belongs to the Meme Soundboard extension, which uses over 600 megabytes of disk space. The vast majority of extensions usually take up less than 10MB.    Extensions can be resource-hungry, and safety is another concern.

{"title": "Singing River ransomware impact larger than initially thought", "published_date": "16 May 2024 ", "description": "A Mississippi healthcare provider has recently provided updates on a ransomware attack that occurred almost 10 months ago.   The ransomware attack forced several hospitals to go offline and manually process patient care for several days, exposing a trove of sensitive patient data.  Singing River started contacting individuals impacted by the August ransomware attack, which severely affected the US hospital system. According to the breach notification letter, which Singing River submitted to the Maine Attorney General, attackers roamed the company‘s systems for over 48 hours in late August of 2023.    Initially, Singing River believed that the cyberattack only impacted approximately 250,000 individuals – now, the number of victims has risen to almost 900,000.   The patient information accessed by the threat actor includes:    Names  Dates of Birth  Addresses  Social Security numbers  Medical information  Health information   Singing River  still states that there is no evidence that any of the data accessed has been misused.   However, individual healthcare data can be sold for hundreds of dollars on dark web forums. For example, malicious actors can use medical details for medical identity theft, a type of fraud where threat actors use stolen information to submit forged claims to Medicare and other health insurers.  Meanwhile, other personally identifiable information (PII) may be used to commit fraud, from  identity theft  and  phishing attacks  to opening new credit accounts, making unauthorized purchases, or obtaining loans under false pretenses.  Who’s behind the attack? The Rhysida ransomware gang, which was behind the attack, breached several hospitals in the late summer of 2023. Three Singing River hospitals and a dozen medical clinics were affected. Its laboratory and radiology testing facilities were forced to work using paper-order tests and radiology exams due to the attack.  The ransomware gang claims to have leaked 80% of the data they collected, allegedly including roughly 420,000 files or 754GB of data, according to Carol Volk of BullWall, a ransomware protection company.     “Hospitals and healthcare systems are prime targets for cybercriminals. The Rhysida ransomware gang claims to have leaked 80% of the data they stole, highlighting the immense challenges of protecting health information. Singing River Health System, with its extensive network of hospitals, clinics, and specialty centers, illustrates the vast attack surface and the inherent vulnerabilities within such a complex IT infrastructure,” Volk said.  “The fallout from such breaches is catastrophic, not only in terms of financial loss but also in the erosion of patient trust and the potential delay or cancellation of critical medical treatments.”    More from Cybernews: Musk's Neuralink issues with tiny wires for years, sources say w/cont.

{"title": "Smart dog collars might help predict earthquakes", "published_date": "13 May 2024 ", "description": "A study on dogs in Lima, Peru, wants to find out whether IoT devices on pets can indicate seismic activity.  Health trackers are gaining momentum not only among humans, but their pets as well. Smart collars can help locate pets and provide owners with useful data regarding the pet’s health, such as heart activity, temperature, or notification about pain.  Despite the obvious convenience, smart devices might provide data beyond their pet-related functions. The creators of the PetPace biometric collar, initially designed to track health data from dogs for early warning signs of disease, see potential in the physiological information it gathers to improve short-term earthquake prediction.    Asaf Dagan, chief scientist and cofounder of PetPace, told ABC News that as well as measuring a pet's vital signs, indicating its stress level in real-time, and processing it in the cloud using AI algorithms, it could also be useful for seismic activity prediction.     Image by PetPace   \"The idea is that if we can track the behavior and the anxiety levels of animals… then we use AI and machine learning advanced models to correlate that with geophysical data like earthquakes of different magnitudes,\" Dagan said to ABC News.  He’s referring to the well-known phenomenon of odd animal behavior before natural disasters. Research has shown that prior to earthquakes, dogs experience high levels of stress and anxiety.   While there is no conclusive evidence that animals have the capability to predict earthquakes, there are documented instances where the behavior of ants, rats, weasels, snakes, centipedes, and domestic animals predicted an upcoming disaster.   PetPace, which was founded in 2012, is currently conducting research on dogs in a seismically very active area of Lima, Peru. If all the dogs in the study exhibit a consistent response time, it's probable that the AI algorithm could detect a pattern indicating an impending earthquake.

{"title": "Neuralink’s brain implant malfunctions in patient's head", "published_date": "09 May 2024 ", "description": "Elon Musk’s startup Neuralink has admitted that part of its brain implant – already in a patient’s head – has malfunctioned, before adding that there was no risk to the person’s safety.  Neuralink has built a brain-computer interface (BCI), saying that it might eventually help patients with paralysis control external technology using only their minds. In January, the device was  implanted  in a 29-year-old patient named Noland Arbaugh.   Later, Musk said that Arbaugh was able to control a computer mouse using his thoughts, and in March, the patient was seen on video  playing chess  while explaining how he became quadriplegic.     Eight years ago, the man was paralyzed below the shoulders after a diving accident. Arbaugh said he was happy that the surgery went “extremely well.”  Now, though, Neuralink has disclosed that it encountered a problem with the implant. A number of the implant’s threads that had been placed in Arbaugh’s brain came out, the company said, and it reduced the amount of data the device could capture.  The Wall Street Journal  first  enquired  to the firm about the issue –and only then Neuralink posted about the problem on its blog, burying it deep in an update.  “In the weeks following the surgery, a number of threads retracted from the brain, resulting in a net decrease in the number of effective electrodes. This led to a reduction in BPS (bits per second),” said Neuralink.  The Wall Street Journal’s  sources said that air might have been trapped inside Arbaugh’s skull after surgery – it’s a condition called pneumocephalus.  To Neuralink, this is a non-issue, it seems. In the  blog post , the firm said: “In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface.”  “These refinements produced a rapid and sustained improvement in BPS that has now superseded Noland’s initial performance,” the company added.  Again,  The Journal’s  sources say that, actually, the possibility of removing Arbaugh’s implant, a so-called “explantation,” was floated – even though the issue hasn’t allegedly posed a risk to the safety of the patient.    Arbaugh is himself quoted in Neuralink’s blog post. He said: “Y'all are giving me too much, it's like a luxury overload. I haven't been able to do these things in 8 years, and now I don't know where to even start allocating my attention.”  On Saturday, he also live-streamed himself on X using the Neuralink implant to navigate around his computer screen and play games.    twitter     Neuralink has obtained the US Food and Drug Administration's approval for studying human brain implants.

{"title": "Meta and Georgia Tech use AI to advance carbon capture solutions", "published_date": "06 May 2024 ", "description": "Tech giant Meta has teamed up with the Georgia Institute of Technology to create a massive open dataset to advance AI solutions for carbon capture, a technology with great potential to help solve the problem of global warming.  Excessive carbon emissions are the main cause of climate change, and we’re already at a place where simply cutting them is not enough – although we should still do that.  Capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air or industries and recycling it is another idea that can sound like a win-win climate solution. This way, greenhouse gases stay out of the atmosphere, allowing us to slow down the current warming that’s beginning to hit dangerous levels.    The challenge, though, is that for direct air capture technology, every sort of environment and location requires a uniquely specific design. The configuration of the technology in Florida would surely be different than one in Finland, for example.  The systems have to be designed with exact parameters for temperature, humidity, and air flows for each location. Such efforts to maximize efficiency take precious time and cost a lot of money – unsurprisingly, most current carbon-capture projects do not pay off.  Now, however, Georgia Tech and Meta say they have collaborated to produce a massive database, potentially making it easier and faster to design and implement direct air capture technologies.  “The open-source database enabled the team to train an AI model that is orders of magnitude faster than existing chemistry simulations. The project,  named OpenDAC , could accelerate climate solutions the planet desperately needs,” said the university in a  press release .   The team’s research was  published  in ACS Central Science, a journal of the American Chemical Society.  “For direct air capture, there are many ideas about how best to take advantage of the air flows and temperature swings of a given environment,” said Andrew J. Medford, associate professor in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (ChBE) and a lead author of the paper. “But a major problem is finding a material that can capture carbon efficiently under each environment’s specific conditions.”  Their idea was to “create a database and a set of tools to help engineers broadly, who need to find the right material that can work,” Medford said. “We wanted to use computing to take them from not knowing where to start to giving them a robust list of materials to synthesize and try.”  It helped that researchers with Meta’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team were looking for ways to harness their machine-learning prowess to address climate change. They landed on direct air capture as a promising technology and went straight to Georgia Tech.    Anuroop Sriram, research engineering lead at FAIR and first author on the paper, generated the database by running quantum chemistry computations on the inputs provided by the Georgia Tech team.   These calculations used about 400 million CPU hours, which is hundreds of times more computing than the average academic computing lab can do in a year. FAIR also trained machine learning models on the database.  It needs to be said, though, that carbon-capture solutions are not universally championed. Sure, in the best cases, the process leaves less carbon dioxide in the environment, and the captured carbon is, for instance, used to produce construction materials such as concrete.   In other words, carbon is captured and sealed, and a product that has economic value is created.  But in worse cases, capturing carbon can be harmful if it eventually increases the amount of excess carbon dioxide in the environment. A good example is using the captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery.  Finally, even if all that is taken into account, the fact is that no carbon-capture technology  works at 100% efficiency , and some carbon dioxide will always escape into the air.

Nico Murillo worked for Tesla for half a decade and “sacrificed a lot for the company,” he said in his viral LinkedIn post.   The post has received plenty of attention, with over 65,000 reactions, 1,500 comments, and 650 reposts at the time of writing this article    Murillo mapped out the timeline of the events that followed.   On Monday, the 15th of April, Murillo could not access his work account. Thinking it was just an IT problem, he opened his email to find this:   “Unfortunately, as a result, your position has been eliminated by this restructuring.”  Murillo then messaged his manager, who confirmed the news, stating, “Everyone got it. We’ll get more information later.”   Bewildered by the news, Murillo attempted to use his badge to enter the Tesla factory. His entrance was denied, and a security guard surveilling the building took his badge from him.   All of this occurred before 6 a.m.   Murillo continued the post by stating that he sacrificed a lot to keep his job.  “At one point in 2023 I was even sacrificing sleeping in my car on work days just to avoid commuting to work. Showered at the factory and slept in the parking lot. Microwaved dinner in the break room,” he stated. But since Murillo is only 29 years old, he  knows  it was just a small chapter for him, and there’s “a whole book waiting to be written.”      This is not the first time Elon Musk, the owner and CEO of Tesla, among other companies such as X, has found himself under the spotlight after similar layoffs of dedicated employees.  One example is when senior executive  Esther Crawford was fired from Twitter  – despite famously sleeping on the office floor to meet Elon Musk’s deadlines.  Crawford’s dedication to her job did not spare her from the company’s latest round of layoffs, according to a tweet by Platformer’s Zoë Schiffer.  Crawford was one of the executives in charge of the Twitter Blue subscription service launched after Musk’s takeover of the company.  She caused some controversy in November when she posted a picture of herself sleeping on the office floor at work, just days after Twitter changed hands.  “When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines, sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” she tweeted at the time.

BerryDunn was notified on September 14th, 2023, that one of its vendors, Reliable Networks of Maine, a network maintenance and monitoring company, had “discovered suspicious network activity that was impacting its network.”  BerryDunn claims to have “immediately implemented its incident response protocols and engaged cybersecurity experts to assist with determining what occurred and whether any data was compromised.”     The information compromised varies from person to person, but the data involved includes:    Names  Addresses  Driver’s license numbers  Non-driver identification cards   The investigation revealed that a threat actor had accessed Reliable’s network and copied data stored on its systems.   BerryDunn's internal investigation concluded on April 2nd, 2024, almost a year after the company was notified of the intrusion.   The accounting firm has “taken steps to secure the HAPG data, such as decommissioning all BerryDunn systems under Reliable’s control and migrating all HAPG data to secure internal BerryDunn systems that are continually monitored as part of our cybersecurity program.”  BerryDunn is offering identity theft protection services through IDX, A Zero Fox Company.

{"title": "Musk decries Australian court “censorship” of X terror posts", "published_date": "23 April 2024 ", "description": "Elon Musk lashed out at Australia's prime minister after a court ordered X to take down footage of an alleged terrorist attack in Sydney, and said the ruling meant any country could control \"the entire internet\".  At a hearing overnight, Australia's Federal Court ordered X, formerly called Twitter, to temporarily hide posts showing video of the incident a week earlier, in which a teenager was charged with terrorism for knifing an Assyrian priest and others.  X said it had already blocked the posts from Australian users, but Australia's e-Safety Commissioner had said the content should be taken down since it showed explicit violence.    \"Does the PM think he should have jurisdiction over all of Earth?\" Musk wrote in a post, referring to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.  The billionaire, who bought X in 2022 with a declared mission to save free speech, posted a meme on the platform that showed X stood for \"free speech and truth\" while other social media platforms represented \"censorship and propaganda\".    twitter     Musk also wrote that \"if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian 'eSafety Commissar' is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?\"  The pushback by the world's third-richest person sets up a new front in the battle between the world's largest internet platforms and countries and nonprofits seeking more oversight of the content hosted on them.  Last month, a US judge threw out a lawsuit by X against the hate speech watchdog, Center for Countering Digital Hate. In Australia, the e-Safety Commissioner fined X A$610,500 ($394,000) last year for failing to cooperate with a probe on anti-child abuse practices. X is fighting that penalty in court.  Albanese hit back at Musk, saying the country would \"do what's necessary to take on this arrogant billionaire who thinks he's above the law, but also above common decency\".  \"The idea that someone would go to court for the right to put up violent content on a platform shows how out-of-touch Mr Musk is,\" Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.    A spokesperson for e-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said the takedown notice was for the attack footage only, and not for \"commentary, public debate or other posts about this event, even those which may link to extreme violent content\".  \"While it may be difficult to eradicate damaging content from the internet entirely, eSafety requires platforms to do everything practical and reasonable to minimise the harm it may cause to Australians and the Australian community,\" the spokesperson added, in a statement.  Although Musk wrote in another post that X had \"blocked the content in question for Australian IP addresses\", the video could be seen on the platform by a Reuters journalist in Australia. A far-right senator also reposted the video on his X account.  On Tuesday, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had used \"internal tools\" to detect and block copies of videos of the church attack and an unrelated, deadly stabbing at a shopping mall in Sydney two days earlier.  Meta said it was removing posts containing \"any glorification or praise\" of the incidents.  Alice Dawkins, executive director of internet policy non-profit Reset.Tech Australia, said Musk's comments fit \"the company's chaotic and negligent approach to the most basic user safety considerations that under previous leadership, the platform used to take seriously.\"    More from Cybernews: UK's new AI traffic cameras monitor seatbelt use, raise privacy concerns  Germany arrests three suspected of giving technology to China  Meta spokesperson Andy Stone sentenced to six years by Russian court  Grindr named in UK lawsuit over sharing HIV data  Android users are at high data tracking risk, study shows  Subscribe to our   newsletter"},
{"title": "Northrop Grumman joins Musk's SpaceX on US spy satellite system", "published_date": "18 April 2024 ", "description": "Aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman is working with SpaceX on a classified spy satellite project already capturing high-resolution imagery of the Earth, according to people familiar with the program.  The program, details of which were first reported by Reuters last month, is meant to enhance the US government's ability to track military and intelligence targets from low-Earth orbits, providing high-resolution imagery of a kind that had traditionally been captured mostly by drones and reconnaissance aircraft.    The inclusion of Northrop Grumman, which has not been previously reported, reflects a desire among government officials to avoid putting too much control of a highly-sensitive intelligence program in the hands of one contractor, four people familiar with the project told Reuters.   \"It is in the government's interest to not be totally invested in one company run by one person,\" one of the people said.  It's unclear whether other contractors are involved at present or could join the project as it develops. Spokespeople at Northrop Grumman and SpaceX, the space venture of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, didn't respond to requests for comment.  Northrop Grumman is providing sensors for some of the SpaceX satellites, the people familiar with the project told Reuters. Two of those people added  Northrop Grumman  will test those satellites at its own facilities before they are launched.  At least 50 of the SpaceX satellites are expected at Northrop Grumman facilities for procedures including testing and the installation of sensors in coming years, one of the people said.    Image by Wirestock Creators | Shutterstock   In March, Reuters reported that the National Reconnaissance Office, or NRO, in 2021 awarded a $1.8 billion contract to SpaceX for the classified project, a planned network of hundreds of satellites.   So far, the people familiar with the project said, SpaceX has launched roughly a dozen prototypes and is already providing test imagery to the NRO, an intelligence agency that oversees development of US spy satellites.    The collection of imagery hasn't been previously reported.  In a statement, an NRO spokesperson said the agency \"has always worked with a diverse group of partners to deliver the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities.\"   The spokesperson declined to comment on specifics of the satellite network or identify any companies that may be involved.  The network's imaging capabilities are designed to have superior resolution over most existing US government spying systems.  It's also designed to address another concern: Currently, US defense and intelligence agencies gather considerable amounts of imagery from drones and reconnaissance aircraft in other countries' sovereign airspace, which poses risks, especially in conflict zones. Placing that image-collection in Earth's orbit reduces the risk, US officials have said.  For SpaceX, known for its rapid launches of reusable rockets and commercial internet satellites, the project is its first known foray into intelligence surveillance services, long the domain of the government and established space contractors.  Since SpaceX began operations over two decades ago, Musk and other company officials have resisted working with established aerospace and defense contractors, many of which they have criticized as bureaucratic and slow.  But even as space and intelligence agencies work more closely with SpaceX, people familiar with the contract said, officials want to ensure that other partners are included.   Northrop Grumman has a long history as a defense and intelligence contractor, already providing the US government with products and services including military satellites, maneuverable spacecraft and space-based communications.  Once the new spy satellite network is fully deployed, the people told Reuters, it will be equipped with an array of different sensors, including optical and radar technology.     The system will also feature relay satellites that can transmit the imagery and other data across the network, two of the people added.

{"title": "Third-party breach hits MFA authenticator Cisco Duo", "published_date": "16 April 2024 ", "description": "Cisco Duo has warned customers that a threat actor gained access to its vendor systems and obtained a set of MFA SMS logs pertaining to customer accounts.   The company did not disclose the name of the breached telephony provider Duo uses to “send multifactor authentication (MFA) messages via SMS and VOIP to its customers.”   Yet, they stated that the threat actor “gained access to the Provider’s internal systems on April 1st, 2024, using a Provider employee’s credentials that the threat actor illicitly obtained through a phishing attack,” the notification email reads.     These credentials were then used to access and download a set of multi-factor authentication (MFA) SMS messages from certain Duo accounts.   While the logs didn’t contain “any message content,” they did contain some sensitive information.   This information includes:    Phone numbers  Phone carriers  Countries  States  Other metadata (dates and time of the message and types of messages)   The notification letter claims that “The Provider” confirmed that the threat actor didn’t download or access any messages or exploit their access to internal systems to send any messages to the affected phone numbers.   Upon discovery, the third-party vendor began investigating the incident and “implemented mitigation measures,” which included “invalidating the employee's credentials, analyzing activity logs, and notifying Cisco of the incident.”   Cisco Duo’s vendor has provided the company with copies of the message logs relevant to affected Duo accounts obtained by the threat actor. Affected individuals can receive copies of these logs, the company said.  Cisco Duo is a two-factor authentication solution company that allows organizations to access company networks and applications securely.     As Cisco Duo is a service used by corporations, the notice urges their clients to “contact (your) customers with affected users whose phone numbers were contained in the message logs.”   The company urges those affected by the breach to remain vigilant and report “suspected social engineering attacks to the relevant incident response team or designated point of contact.”   Cisco Duo claims to serve 100,000 customers globally and manages 1 billion monthly authentication users.

{"title": "New AI act forces companies to disclose use of copyrighted content", "published_date": "11 April 2024 ", "description": "New legislation introduced in the US House of Representatives demands that companies disclose copyrighted content used to train artificial intelligence models.   Adam Schiff, a United States representative, has introduced new legislation that requires all companies dealing in artificial intelligence (AI) to disclose what copyrighted material they used to train their generative AI.   If passed, this bill, known as the Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act, will force AI companies to be transparent about what content their AI is trained on or face a fine of at least $5000.     This new act will apply to new and existing models and demands the formal submission of all copyrighted works “used in building or altering the training data set for that system,” a press release on the Adam Schiff website reads.   The information must be filed to the Copyright Office 30 days before the model becomes publicly available.   Generative AI models are trained on a multitude of content, including anything from articles to social media posts.   Naturally, as these models scrape the internet for a diverse range of data, which is required to train generative AI, they will most likely encounter copyrighted content that could be used without the creator's knowledge.   There have been many disputes over using copyrighted content to train AI models.   One notable case involved the New York Times and its legal battle against tech giants OpenAI and Microsoft.   The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft , accusing them of using millions of newspaper articles without permission to train artificial intelligence technologies.

{"title": "Benetton Group claimed by Hunters International ransomware gang", "published_date": "04 April 2024 ", "description": "Global fashion company Benetton Group has allegedly been attacked by the ransomware gang Hunters International. The cybercriminals claim to have exfiltrated 433GB of data.  Hunters International listed Benetton Group on its leak site on April 3rd, at around 6 p.m. GMT.  There’s no official confirmation about the incident yet, and it is unclear what systems or data may have been affected. Cybernews has reached out to Benetton Group and is awaiting a response.    Ten files containing 33.8MB of Clients’ data will be disclosed after one day and 16 hours, according to the dark web posting by the gang. No data samples are provided, nor are any threats listed.  Such action may be part of a common extortion technique used by ransomware groups, as they typically release parts of sensitive data publicly if a ransom is not paid within a specified timeframe.  Benetton Group is one of the world’s best-known fashion companies and is based in Ponzano Veneto, Italy. The network has about 4,000 stores and more than 6000 employees worldwide, according to the company’s website.     Hunters rose from the ashes of Hive Hunters International emerged on the ransomware scene after one of the world’s most dangerous ransomware groups, Hive,  disappeared after being infiltrated by the FBI.  A new gang, Hunters International, recorded a sudden increase in activity using a similar code since last October.  “It appears that the leadership of the Hive group made the strategic decision to cease its operations and transfer its remaining assets to another group, Hunters International,” according to Bitdefender’s report.    The gang has itself challenged the initial consensus that Hive has simply rebranded to Hunters.  “We started to see that someone falsely decided that we are the Hive ransomware group based on a 60% similarity of encryption code. All of the Hive source codes were sold including the website and old Golang and C versions and we are those who purchased them. Unfortunately for us, we found a lot of mistakes that caused unavailability for decryption in some cases. All of them were fixed now,” Hunters International said, addressing the speculation in a rare statement.  Hunters claims to focus on data exfiltration rather than data encryption, using the chance to acquire proven ransomware code from the dismantled group. The gang appears to be opportunistic, with no specific focus on regions or industries.  “In double-extortion scenarios, the goal is not just to encrypt but also to steal data. Even a functional backup may not fully address this issue, as the stolen data remains a concern, highlighting the importance of a defense-in-depth security approach,” Bitdefender researchers warn.  According to the Cybernews  Ransomlooker tool , Hunters International was among the top five most active ransomware gangs last month. They claimed 23 victims in March and 89 victims in total since October 2023.

{"title": "Google AI could soon use a cough to determine disease type", "published_date": "25 March 2024 ", "description": "A team of Google scientists has reportedly created a machine-learning tool that can help diagnose diseases by evaluating noises such as coughing and breathing.  Last week, Google  showcased  new healthcare product innovations and research and said that AI-powered products and generative models are designed to help users better understand their own health data.  Well, how about a cough? According to the researchers who reported the tool earlier in March in a preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed ( PDF ), the newly developed AI system has been trained on millions of audio clips of human sounds.    The system, called Health Acoustic Representations (HeAR), could be used to diagnose diseases, including COVID-19 and tuberculosis, and to assess how well a person’s lungs are functioning.  For now, the new tool is only aimed at other researchers and will probably reach physicians one day, but its promise for use in the general population seems huge – imagine being tortured by constant coughing but immediately finding out what type of drugs you should use to get better.  “Health acoustic sounds such as coughs and breaths are known to contain useful health signals with significant potential for monitoring health and disease, yet are underexplored in the medical machine learning community,” say the researchers.  They used self-supervised learning, which relies on unlabelled data. Through an automated process, the scientists extracted more than 300 million short sound clips of coughing, breathing, throat clearing, and other human sounds from publicly available YouTube videos.  Each clip was then converted into a visual representation of sound called a spectrogram. The researchers then blocked segments of the spectrograms to help the model learn to predict the missing portions.   This is actually quite similar to how the large language model that powers the ChatGPT bot was taught to predict the next word in a sentence.  Finally, using this method, the researchers created what they call a foundation model, which they say can be adapted for many tasks.  Scientists have explored using sound as a biomarker for disease previously. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, they discovered that it was possible to detect a respiratory disease through a person’s cough.    HeAR’s advantage is the massive dataset that it was trained on. Besides, the system can be fine-tuned to perform multiple tasks. However, the researchers admit that it’s too early to tell when or even whether HeAR will become a commercial product.  The plan for now is to give interested researchers access to the model and to spur further innovation in the field, Sujay Kakarmath, a product manager at Google who worked on the project,  told  Nature.

Attackers announced the supposed breach on a well-known data leak forum, claiming that they’ve obtained details of millions of France’s football players.  We have reached out to the FFF for confirmation but have not immediately received a response.    The Cybernews research team looked into the data sample attackers provided, concluding that the information posted appears to be legitimate.    Attackers' post on a data leak forum. Image by Cybernews.   The post on the data leak forum says that attackers obtained details on over ten million individuals, including their names, phone numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, transfer requests, league and club the user belongs to, info related to these memberships, and other personal information.  While the attackers claim they’ve obtained information on over ten million individuals, the official website of FFF indicates the federation unites 2.22 million members, 1.87 million players, 400,000 volunteers, and 14,000 amateur clubs.  However, as security researchers at HackManac noted, the stolen database could have details on present and past members of the federation.  Attackers frequently target sports organizations as they often store data on a large number of individuals. For example, last October, ASVEL Basket, a French basketball team owned by the former NBA star Tony Parker,  was claimed  by a ransomware cartel.  Sometimes, organizations inadvertently leak the data themselves. Earlier this year, the Cybernews research team discovered that Australia’s football governing body, Football Australia,  leaked  secret keys potentially opening access to 127 buckets of data, including ticket buyers’ data and players’ contracts and documents.

{"title": "European cloud providers: Broadcom’s pricing will push us out of business", "published_date": "19 March 2024 ", "description": "Europe’s cloud operator association CISPE calls for an EU intervention on Broadcom’s “brutal” VMware licensing policy changes.  Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) is urging regulators, legislators, and courts across Europe to swiftly scrutinize Broadcom’s decision and warns that critical services such as healthcare may be affected.  After Broadcom acquired the virtualization company VMware and unilaterally canceled all licenses for its software, European cloud services vendors and customers “are left in limbo without clarity as to how, when, or if they’ll be able to license VMware software from 1st April 2024,” according to the CISPE’s press release.    Some cloud providers stated that over 75% of their revenues depend on VMware software virtualization technologies.  “Costs for licenses have increased by a factor of twelve (i.e., 1,200%) in some cases,” the press release reads. “Several CISPE members have stated that without the ability to license and use VMware products, they will quickly go bankrupt and out of business.”  “Cloud customers, including public sector bodies, large European businesses, SMEs and start-ups are all threatened by egregious and unwarranted new contract terms and price increases. CISPE is calling for, at minimum, an immediate pause to contract terminations and the ability of customers to exit the multi-year contract imposed by Broadcom as soon as viable alternatives become available.”  Europe‘s leading cloud providers say they received only a few weeks’ termination notice, and hundreds of products have been discontinued without any notice. The remaining products were re-bundled through new contract terms without any technical modifications or software developments “in ways that unfairly increase costs for customers.”  CISPE cited that the new terms include “minimum commitments amounting to tens of millions of euros over three-year periods.”  “Broadcom is holding the sector to ransom by leveraging VMware’s dominance of the virtualization sector to enforce unfair license terms and extract unfair rents from European cloud customers,” commented Francisco Mingorance, secretary general of CISPE. “These changes harm European customers and cloud service providers, increasing costs and reducing choice.”  European cloud providers suggest that Broadcom should be regarded as a Gatekeeper under the terms of the new Digital Markets Act, as VMware held almost 45% of the virtualization market in 2023.  “Cloud services essential to public and private sector organizations, including local government, hospitals and universities as well as commercial businesses could go offline in a two weeks’ time,” CISPE warned.    Broadcom is an American producer of semiconductors and infrastructure software products. After the acquisition of VMware, the company stopped selling licenses and moved into a subscription-based pricing model. In a blog post, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan admitted that the  change  “has understandably created some unease among our customers and partners.”  “But all of these moves have been with the goals of innovating faster, meeting our customers’ needs more effectively, and making it easier to do business with us. We also expect these changes to provide greater profitability and improved market opportunities for our partners,” Tan said.  Broadcom calculates that subscription prices have even been reduced. However, many users do not need all the products included with the license packages but still have to pay for them, heise.de writes.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK already stated that the merger could restrict competition and reduce customer choice.  “We are concerned this deal could allow Broadcom to cut out competitors from the supply of hardware components to the server market and lead to less innovation at a time when most firms want fast, responsive, and affordable IT systems,” David Stewart, executive director at the CMA,  said .

{"title": "Elon Musk’s xAI open-sources Grok", "published_date": "18 March 2024 ", "description": "The base model of xAI’s chatbot Grok is now available on GitHub for anyone to use freely for their own projects.   The model was released under the Apache 2.0 license, which allows the commercial use of the underlying technology behind Grok. However, the release does not include the training code used for the model.  “We are releasing the base model weights and network architecture of Grok-1, our large language model. Grok-1 is a 314 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model trained from scratch by xAI,” the company said in a blog post.     It said the “raw” base model was from Grok’s pre-training phase, which concluded in October last year. “This means that the model is not fine-tuned for any specific application, such as dialogue,” xAI said.  Billionaire Elon Musk announced that he would  open-source his ChatGPT rival last week , just days after suing OpenAI, which he helped found. Musk accused the Microsoft-backed firm and its CEO, Sam Altman, of abandoning its original nonprofit mission in favor of a money-making model.  OpenAI responded to the lawsuit by publishing Musk’s old emails, in which he appeared to advocate the for-profit setup, even suggesting the venture should be merged with Tesla so it could become its “cash cow.”   xAI released Grok last year to X Premium+ subscribers. Other companies that have open-sourced some of their AI models include Meta, Mistral, and Google.

{"title": "EU opens probe against AliExpress over illegal content", "published_date": "14 March 2024 ", "description": "The European Commission has started formal proceedings against AliExpress, an online marketplace owned by China’s tech giant Alibaba, for potentially violating its new Digital Services Act (DSA).   The EU’s executive branch said AliExpress may have breached the DSA “in areas linked to the management and mitigation of risks, to content moderation and the internal complaint handling mechanism, to the transparency of advertising and recommender systems, to the traceability of traders and to data access for researchers.”   It said the investigation would focus on whether AliExpress failed to properly enforce its own terms of service that prohibit products posing risks to consumers’ health such as fake medicines and food, as well as dietary supplements.     The probe will also look into whether AliExpress was involved in any violations that allowed minors to access pornographic material, which the European Commission said consumers can still find on the platform.   AliExpress may lack effective measures to prevent the dissemination of illegal content, the European Commission said. It also questioned whether the platform was doing enough to prevent intentional manipulation through “hidden links” and “influencers promoting illegal or harmful products” through its affiliate program.  Other areas of the probe include an obligation under the DSA for the e-commerce site to provide an effective internal complaint-handling system and a searchable and reliable repository for ads that are provided on the platform. Among other things, the investigators will also address how AliExpress recommends its products to users.  The probe against AliExpress is the third formal investigation opened under the DSA since it came into effect in February. Similar proceedings were started against social media platforms TikTok and X.  The regulation’s goal is to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, including hate speech and cyberbullying, as well as the spread of disinformation.  “Consumer protection, especially for minors, is an essential cornerstone of the Digital Services Act. AliExpress must respect its obligations to mitigate the systemic risks on its platform and apply all safeguard provisions to ensure its services are safe,” said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president at the European Commission.   In a statement sent to  Cybernews , AliExpress said it respects “all applicable rules and regulations in the markets where we operate.”   It said it will continue to work with relevant authorities on “making sure we comply with applicable standards and will continue to ensure that we will be able to meet the requirements of the DSA.”     “AliExpress is committed to creating a safe and compliant marketplace for all consumers,” it said.

{"title": "Apple greenlights downloading apps from websites", "published_date": "12 March 2024 ", "description": "Software developers who use Apple's App Store will be able to distribute apps to EU users directly from their websites this spring as part of changes required by new EU rules forcing Apple to open up its closed ecosystem.  The European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which kicked in last week, requires Apple to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%.  \"We're providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union, including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer's website,\" Apple said in a blog post.    \"Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs (application programming interfaces) that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, backup and restore users' apps, and more,\" the company said.  Other changes include allowing developers who set up alternative app marketplaces to offer a catalog solely made up of the marketplace developer's own apps with immediate effect.  Developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts, and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their website instead of using Apple's template.  Service providers, such as streaming platform  Spotify, lauded  the opportunities DMA provides earlier this year, calling Apple’s long-standing policies “nuts.”  Apple's  changes  come amid continuing criticism from rivals that its compliance efforts are falling short.   The DMA launched focusing on six major tech companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok owner ByteDance. DMA violations can cost companies fines as much as ten percent of their global turnover.  Earlier this month,  Apple said  that while EU users will be allowed to download third-party apps, the apps will stop updating if users stay out of the EU for over 30 days.

{"title": "Stormous claims cyberattack on Belgian brewer", "published_date": "07 March 2024 ", "description": "The ransomware group Stormous has claimed responsibility for the cyberattack on Duvel Moortgat brewery on Wednesday – but drinkers will be relieved to learn it has enough beer in stock to weather the storm.   The ransom gang took to dark web on March 7th, the day after the attack, to list Duvel as its latest victim. As yet there is no sign of the Belgian brewer caving in to any ransom demands, nor any indication as to what those demands may be.      Stormous lists victims on the dark web - at the top it names Belgian brewer Duvel Moortgat, which reported suffering a ransomware attack yesterday   So raise a glass, if you can, to the fortitude of Duvel Moortgat, after it told local media in Belgium alarms went off in the early hours of March 6th at its IT department, which scrambled to meet the incoming ransomware attack.  “Ransomware had been detected,” said spokesperson Ellen Aarts later that day. “Production was therefore immediately stopped. It is not yet known when it could start again. We hope today or tomorrow.”  But she added: “We have more than enough beer in stock to cover this production stop.”  Duvel’s brewery is in Breendonk, Antwerp. Best known for its eponymously named Duvel, a golden ale sold internationally and noted for its strength and flavor, it also produces the popular Vedett and Maredsous beers.  Predictably, Belgian beer drinkers reacted to news of the incident posted on Reddit with typical bar-room humor.  “This must be met with nuclear retaliation,” joked drunkbelgianwolf.  “I think this should be classified under National Emergency,” agreed De-Roymeester.    Modoz, however, had an insight to offer. “My friend working there just told me that the beer pumps are still working,” they posted, “so all people working there (except IT) are now drinking beers in the cafeteria.”  Which, Cybernews must note, is really too bad for the IT department.  At the time of writing, it is not yet known precisely when Duvel Moortgat will resume full-scale production – nor who was responsible for the attack.

{"title": "Discord military leaker pleads guilty, gets 16 years", "published_date": "05 March 2024 ", "description": "Former US airman Jack Teixeira has pleaded guilty to leaking US military secrets on a Discord group to impress his fellow gamers. He confessed to his crimes, knowing that the attorney general would impose a sentence of 200 months in prison.  Teixeira, 22, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, a former cybersecurity professional and Air National Guardsman, was  arrested by the FBI last April  after it emerged he had shared online top-secret documents, including those pertaining to Ukraine’s air defenses and troop movements during the Russian invasion, and Israel's Mossad spy agency.    A US Department of Justice (DoJ) document filed on March 4th but dating from February 28th stated that Teixeira would “plead guilty to counts one through to six” of the charges filed against him, “each charging Defendant with Willful Retention and Transmission of National Defense Information in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 793(e).”  The former Airman First Class of the 102nd Intelligence Wing faced up to ten years in jail on each of the six counts against him. However, as part of the plea bargain, the DoJ said it would be “bound by a range of incarceration of between 132 and 200 months,” with the attorney general opting for the maximum tariff.  He also faces three years of supervised release after serving his sentence and a fine of $50,000 that the court agreed to waive should he be unable to afford it.  Teixeira agreed to waive the right to appeal his sentence unless it is later proven his lawyer failed to act diligently, or any member of the prosecution or police involved in the case engaged in serious misconduct.    Facebook and Fox News   ‘Violated his oath’ “Mr. Teixeira exploited his top-secret security clearance to share our nation’s secrets on a social media platform,” said acting US attorney Joshua Levy for the District of Massachusetts. “He violated his oath to preserve, protect and defend and, in doing so, he undermined our national security and risked the safety of Americans serving overseas and our allies.”  Levy added: “Every instance of mishandling classified information weakens our defense and compromises our ability to thwart potential threats. We cannot afford to underestimate the gravity of this conduct; it has far-reaching consequences that transcend individual interests.”    Previously described as a  gun-loving white nationalist  by the prosecution, Teixeira is said to have boasted of the privileged access to classified information his job as a serviceman gave him.   Sowing discord on Discord Teixeira was said to have posted images of the secret military documents on his Discord chat group “Thug Shaker Central” on or around January 2022 – complete with US government stamps marking them as TOP SECRET.  Though the “thug shakers” were only about two dozen strong, a member shared the military documents on another forum. This led them to spread like wildfire across the internet and eventually reach the eyes of the Pentagon.  After Teixeira’s arrest, US President Joe Biden ordered an investigation of the Massachusetts Air National Guard to determine how a low-ranking guardsman could gain access to classified information.  Rajan Koo, chief technical officer of DTEX Systems, agreed that “the Teixeira incident revealed critical gaps in insider risk management within federal agencies.”  “As the Air Force navigates these challenges, the federal sector finds itself at a crucial juncture, with an opportunity to learn, adapt, and fortify insider risk strategies to better safeguard national security,” said Koo.   “Individuals granted security clearances are entrusted with protecting our nation’s most sensitive secrets, and Teixeira knowingly betrayed that trust and put the country at risk,” said an FBI spokesperson the day the plea bargain was made public. “The FBI will continue to work with our partners to hold accountable anyone who would endanger our national security interests.”             More from Cybernews:  UnitedHealth rumored to have paid $22M to ALPHV/BlackCat hackers   Anthropic: new Claude 3 AI outperforms rivals GPT-4, Gemini 1.0   SpaceX launches Google-backed satellite to fight climate change   American Express says customer data exposed in third-party breach   What the most popular FemTech apps know about you    Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "UnitedHealth cyberattack payment freeze sparks provider panic", "published_date": "29 February 2024 ", "description": "Payment to hundreds, if not thousands, of US healthcare providers has been frozen – just another devastating symptom of last week's cyberattack on UnitedHealth Group’s (UHG) Change Healthcare. This is as UHG officially acknowledges the ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware hit in its latest update.   Some of the smaller practices have reported to be in financial straits due to the payment processing stoppage, struggling to pay their office bills, and even employees.   Large hospital chains have also been impacted as a result of Change Healthcare being forced take its payment and billing management systems offline since the February 21st attack.     According to the American Hospital Association (AHA)   –   which  represents nearly 5,000 hospitals, healthcare systems, networks, and other providers   –    the bigger hospitals, unlike smaller medical practices, are absorbing the costs of non-payment upfront. At least for now.   A conference call recording of several hospital cybersecurity officers was obtained by health and science news site Stat News on Thursday, which heard the officers say the outage could last for weeks.  The news outlet reported that UHG’s Chief Operating Officer Dirk McMahon had said the company was in the process of setting up a loan program for providers who are unable to submit insurance claims while systems are offline.  McMahon said the loan program will last \"for the next couple of weeks as this continues to go on,\" the outlet reported.      As of last week, patients trying to fill prescriptions at both their retail chain pharmacies and local mom-and-pop shops also reported delays in all fifty states since the attack began nine days ago, the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) said.  The APhA had urged people to talk to their pharmacists if they ran out of medicine, but on day six of the attack, UnitedHealth announced they were able to provide “ effective workarounds ”   for most clients, averting what could have been a post-pandemic health disaster.     Still, neither  Change Healthcare  nor parent company Optum – both under the UnitedHealth Group conglomerate since 2017 – have been able to estimate when its systems will come back online, even with the assistance of outside security experts from Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks.  ALPHV/BlackCat confirmed UHG put out a fresh statement Thursday finally addressing the ransomware rumors which have been circulating about the notorious  ALPHV/BlackCat  cybercriminal gang since Monday.   The ransomware cartel posted the  intricate details  about the attack on its dark leak site blog, including how much data was exfiltrated (6T), how many patient records were stolen (in the millions), and a name-dropping sample of the number of companies impacted (in the thousands).  “Change Healthcare can confirm we are experiencing a cyber security issue perpetrated by a cybercrime threat actor who has represented itself to us as ALPHV/BlackCat,” UHG said in a statement sent to Cybernews.  “We are actively working to understand the impact to members, patients and customers,” the California-based healthcare giant said.   “Patient care is our top priority and we have multiple workarounds to ensure people have access to the medications and the care they need,” it said.      Change Healthcare is one of the largest health technology software companies in the US, servicing roughly 85 million patients or 25% of the US population, according to Becker’s Hospital Review.   Magnitude of impact still unknown    While the financial losses are staggering, it’s the impact on patient care that is even more concerning, explained Jon Miller, CEO & Co-founder of the American anti-ransomware firm Halcyon.   Miller said recent studies have shown that “68% of healthcare providers surveyed said ransomware attacks resulted in a disruption to patient care.”   Miller said factors contributing to those “negative patient outcomes” include temporary suspension or rerouting of emergency services, canceled medical procedures – and downed billing systems, which is exactly what happened in the UHG hack.  Even more disturbing, Miller noted that roughly 40% of the providers said ransom attacks on a healthcare organization also lead to increased mortality rates and complications in medical procedures.   Although just a snapshot of the larger picture, half a dozen health entities – five small therapy practices and one laboratory – spoke with Reuters about the payment processing issues, which started for all six last week.   The businesses told Reuters the frozen payments were causing them to rack up thousands of dollars in overdue payments.  \"We are 100 percent down when it comes to billing right now,\" said legal director Phil Seubring of Forensic Fluids, a Michigan-based lab that does drug testing for doctors' offices.  Clinical social worker Jenna Wilson from California also said she is not getting paid. Wolfson, who sees over two dozen patients a week, said she had about $4,000 in unprocessed claims. \"This could be catastrophic for me and other small business mental health practitioners,\" she said.   According to John Riggi, American Health Association cybersecurity adviser and former FBI cyber division section chief, remediating just core services can easily take 30 days or more, with less important functions taking weeks.

{"title": "LoanDepot finally reveals what data was exposed in Jan hack", "published_date": "26 February 2024 ", "description": "American online mortgage lender loanDepot has finally revealed exactly what sensitive customer information was exposed during a January cyberattack – since claimed by the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gang.  The California-based non-bank lender (NBL) Monday provided the Maine Attorney General’s Office a copy of the breach notification letter sent out to those whose data may have been compromised during the attack.   According to the latest numbers, 16,924,071 people have been affected so far. That’s about 300K more individuals than the original amount of 16.6 million filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 8th, about six weeks ago.     In its original  SEC 8K filing , loanDepot admitted that some of its data had been \"encrypted\" in the attack, but did not disclose what that data might be – until now.   “We are writing to inform you of a data security incident in which your sensitive personal information may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party,” the February 23rd breach notification letter states.     loanDepot breach notification letter   LoanDepot said its investigation showed the attack took place from January 3rd through January 5th, with the company first becoming aware of “the unauthorized third party gaining access to certain of our systems” on or about January 4th.   Personally identifiable information (PII) stored in those systems included:    Name, address, phone number,  Date of birth.  Email address,  Financial account numbers,  Social security number.   It's not clear which financial account numbers the company is referring to (banking, mortgage, etc.), and loanDepot has still not divulged the amount of data that may have been stolen by the attackers.   The  loanDeopt cyberattack  forced the company to take its systems offline, leaving many frustrated mortgage customers unable to log in or pay their bills for about a week. All loanDepot’s multiple portals and services were fully restored by January 19th, according to the company.     When Cybernews asked loanDepot why it waited six weeks to reveal what customer data was exposed, the company “declined to comment.”  LoanDepot announced in the  letter  it would provide two years of free identity protection and credit monitoring services for those affected, and will waive all late fees for the time period in question.  Claimed by ALPHV/BlackCat “Your information is in the final process of being sold. That's all,” the Russian-linked ransomware gang wrote.   ALPHV/BlackCat named the home lender on its leak blog February 16th, accompanied by a lengthy post singling out the company for “cutting corners” and failing to pay up.   ALPHV also called out the online mortgage firm for not disclosing “the full amount of data stolen,” according to its post.  “We downloaded multiple databases from credit bureaus that included personal information about American citizens, even those who had never applied for any of their products From their accesses,” the group said.      ALPHV/BlackCat leak site   Furthermore, ALPHV claims loanDepot “withheld information about 4 TB of additional data that included comprehensive client data.”  The gang blamed the so-called failed ransom negotiations on the company’s legal team, insurance underwriters, and being “unable to make up their minds.”     “They offered $6 million for the data and decryptor… we waited over the weekend – a tactic used by negotiators. After the weekend was over, they disappeared,” ALPHV wrote.  Additionally, the gang implied it had sources at the company feeding them inside information.   “The CIO [Chief Information Officer] was 10 steps behind us and was feeding the Executive team false information on purpose. Our insiders at this company informed us that they were being pressured to leave [the negotiations] by their outside counsel,” the post said.   “As their networks were being taken over, they took weeks to make a decision… and finally turned to leave” ALPHV added.   First observed in 2021, ALPHV/BlackCat is known to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model by selling malware subscriptions to criminals.  The group was tracked by ReliaQuest as the third most active ransomware cartel operating in Q3 2023 carrying out hundreds of attacks and causing an estimated loss of over $1 billion alone in 2023.  Known for its triple-extortion tactics, the gang was responsible for the September ransomware attacks on the Las Vegas casino giants   MGM Resorts , as well as   Caesars International , who is rumored to have paid a $15 million ransom to keep operations running.

{"title": "Wyze camera breach allowed 13,000 people to spy on strangers", "published_date": "21 February 2024 ", "description": "Smart camera maker Wyze has disclosed that some users last week were able to see footage from cameras that were installed in other homes. The firm blames the security glitch on its cloud computing partner, AWS.  In an email to users and more updates on its website, Wyze, the maker of cheap smart cameras, said that the outage last Friday lasted several hours and briefly left camera footage inaccessible.  While the firm was working to bring the devices online, around 13,000 users saw wrong thumbnails from other users in the Wyze app, the email said. About 1,500 users actually clicked on them and were able to see the footage from other people’s homes.    “Most of these taps enlarged the image, but we found a few cases with things like Cam Plus Lite and sound detection events where the thumbnail was attached to an event video and the video was viewed,”  said  Wyze.  The company is blaming the incident – now fixed – on “a third-party caching client library, the Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system allegedly “received unprecedented load conditions caused by devices coming back online all at once” because of the surge in demand and mixed up IDs between devices and users.  To prevent a similar issue from occurring again, Wyze added a new layer of verification for users to see thumbnails and videos and, of course, notified the affected users. The firm stressed that “99.75% of all Wyze accounts were not affected by the security event.\"  The problem is that this isn’t the first security incident that’s hit Wyze. In September 2023, another  web caching issue  left the feeds of 10 users viewable to thousands of strangers.   And in 2019, a data leak exposed millions of user email addresses as well as the email addresses of people who were given permission to view the camera feeds.   That’s why Wyze’s public repentance doesn’t seem too convincing: “We know this is very disappointing news. It does not reflect our commitment to protect customers or mirror the other investments and actions we have taken in recent years to make security a top priority at Wyze.”  Still, other smart camera makers have also been facing issues. In 2022, Amazon had to urgently  fix a vulnerability in its Ring app  that could have exposed users’ personal data, location, and camera recordings.   In 2019, a hacker accessed a family’s Ring camera and told their 8-year-old daughter he was Santa Claus. The man also encouraged the minor to destroy the room. Ring claimed that the hacker did not actually gain access to the camera through a data breach.

{"title": "Paramount botches Super Bowl livestream: more problems ahead?", "published_date": "13 February 2024 ", "description": "The Paramount+ livestream of the Super Bowl crashed for multiple users who, of course, took to social media to complain. Big live events are still a problem for streamers, it seems.  The Super Bowl drew a staggering 123.4 million viewers, who tuned in to watch the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers. That’s the most for any American broadcast since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot on the Moon on July 20th, 1969.  People could watch the game in six different ways. One of those platforms, Paramount+, disappointed many, though.    Viewers watching on Paramount+ had to deal with several crashes, the broadcast being behind by around 30 seconds, and other kinds of glitches. For many, the problems made the broadcast “unwatchable,” and they had to look for other ways to watch the game.    twitter     Right before the game started, Paramount+ users suddenly found themselves locked out of the streaming platform as well. It has more than 21 million subscribers.  Paramount+ acknowledged the issues after the fact: “The vast majority of users experienced an uninterrupted stream, but we are aware that a very small number of subscribers experienced an error due to a technical issue with one of our partners, which was quickly rectified.”  Paramount Streaming’s chief technology officer  told  Fast Company last week that there were “over 500 team members across five offices around the United States that are all working together to ensure that everything goes smoothly.” Apparently, that kind of effort still wasn’t enough.  Streaming is getting more popular each year. Nielsen said that streaming grabbed a record 38.7% of total TV usage in the US in July 2023 – this was a new high for the category.   But livestreaming is still a big challenge for companies – when a lot of people want to watch the same thing on the internet at the same time, problems begin. ESPN’s livestream of the World Cup in 2014 was a perfect example.  It doesn’t even have to be sports – Netflix struggled to show a live episode of  Love is Blind  less than a year ago. It also doesn’t have to be a livestream – HBO had issues showing  Game of Thrones  and  True Detective  in 2014.    Part of the problem is the architecture of the internet itself, where data is broken up into “packets,” which are routed in different paths and then reassembled upon reaching the destination.   In other words, the process doesn’t work very well for live video because the web was designed for non-real-time traffic.  Still, streaming companies should probably invest more in technology and ensure that the viewer experience is as smooth as possible. Disney, Warner Bros., and Fox are getting ready to  launch a new mega sports streamer  this fall.  Hoping to attract new sign-ups with live events, Netflix also paid $5 billion to  acquire rights  to broadcast live wrestling from 2025.

{"title": "Google to launch anti-misinformation campaign ahead of EU elections", "published_date": "16 February 2024 ", "description": "Google is preparing to launch an anti-misinformation campaign across five countries in the European Union (EU), the company told Reuters in an exclusive on Thursday.  The campaign also coincides with new and tougher rules coming into effect later this month aimed at tackling online content.   In June, EU citizens will elect a new European Parliament to pass policies and laws in the region and lawmakers fear the spread of misinformation online could sway voters.    France, Poland and Germany accused Russia on Monday of putting together an elaborate network of websites to spread pro-Russian propaganda.  Europe's Digital Services Act, which comes into force this week, will require very large online platforms and search engines to do more to tackle illegal content and risks to public security.  This spring, Google's internal Jigsaw unit which operates to tackle threats to societies, will run a series of animated ads across platforms such as TikTok and YouTube in five EU countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland.  Building on previous campaigns the company has tested in Germany and central Europe, Jigsaw said the new project was an opportunity to reach citizens in countries with some of the largest number of voters in the EU, utilizing the company's local expertise in these regions.  The ads will feature so-called \"prebunking\" techniques, developed in partnership with researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Bristol, aimed at helping viewers identify manipulative content before encountering it.  Viewers watching the ads on YouTube will be asked to fill in a short multiple-choice questionnaire, designed to gauge what they have learned about misinformation.  \"We've spent so much time having these really polarized debates. Our democracy is at stake, and the temperature just keeps getting higher and higher,\" said Beth Goldberg, head of research at Jigsaw.  \"Prebunking is the only technique, at least that I've seen, that works equally effectively across the political spectrum,\" Goldberg said.    Other measures to control misinformation like fact checking can add to polarization because they come after the information has already spread, she added.  Last month, an investigation conducted by the EEAS (European Union External Action Service) uncovered 750 incidents of misleading information being deliberately spread by foreign actors, many voicing support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Jigsaw's ads will be translated into all 24 official EU languages, the company said.  The campaign will run for at least one month, with a view to extend it based on reach and performance. Results from the campaign, including survey responses and the number of people reached, are expected to be published in summer 2024.

{"title": "Chinese hackers spent at least five years in US critical networks", "published_date": "08 February 2024 ", "description": "Top US agencies claim to have confirmed that China has planted cyber-intruders in American critical infrastructure. More alarmingly, they seem to believe these digital sleeper agents could have been placed years ago for deployment in a future military conflict.  The provocative statement was jointly made on February 7th by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the National Security Agency (NSA), and centers on a Chinese-backed cyber outfit known as Volt Typhoon.    It would appear to mark a doubling down by the US on its stance that China is the greatest long-term threat to American national interests – claims that the People’s Republic has denied.  “US authoring agencies have recently observed indications of Volt Typhoon actors maintaining access and footholds within some victim IT environments for at least five years,” said the FBI, CISA, and NSA in their statement.   They add that the Chinese-backed group members “conduct extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance to learn about the target organization and its environment.”  This entails tailoring tactics to specific targets and maintaining a persistent presence within compromised systems long after a breach, the agencies added.  American targets selected by Volt Typhoon – aka Vanguard Panda and Bronze Silhouette – included critical infrastructure such as wastewater, communications, energy, and transport systems.  But rather than be motivated by espionage, as is often the case with suspected Chinese threat actors, Volt Typhoon agents appear to be biding their time to cause more tangible damage at a later date, the statement suggests.  “Volt Typhoon’s choice of targets and pattern of behavior is not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence-gathering operations,” the US agencies said, adding that they “assess with high confidence” that the group’s agents are “pre-positioning themselves on IT networks to enable lateral movement.”  Lateral movement occurs when a threat actor uses a breach point to move around to other parts of a target’s computer network, potentially wreaking havoc.    In the case of Volt Typhoon, the FBI and its co-authors have expressed a concern “about the potential for these actors to use their network access for disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts.”  The agencies say they observed the group’s activities last May, prompting further investigation that led them to confirm the intrusions and assess that actors backed by China are preparing for “destructive or disruptive cyberattacks against US critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict.”  The stark warning is merely the prelude to a more  detailed report  released by the three agencies and counter-signed by parallel security bodies in the UK, Canada, and Australia.  “This activity is part of a broader campaign in which Volt Typhoon actors have successfully infiltrated the networks of critical infrastructure organizations in the continental and non-continental United States and its territories,” the report said.  The methods of attack chosen by Volt Typhoon to gain an initial foothold in a target organization’s systems also include using zero-day vulnerabilities – ones that cybersecurity defenders have been previously unaware of – in public-facing appliances such as routers, virtual private networks, and firewalls, as well as stealing admin credentials that have been poorly secured.  “After successfully gaining access to legitimate accounts, Volt Typhoon actors exhibit minimal activity within the compromised environment [...] suggesting their objective is to maintain persistence rather than immediate exploitation,” it added.

{"title": "MIT student claims to hack Apple Vision Pro on launch day", "published_date": "05 February 2024 ", "description": "An Apple Vision Pro user claims to have already found vulnerabilities in the popular augmented reality headset.  Joseph Ravichandran, a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), shared an image on X with what looks like a Kernel exploit for Apple’s newly launched virtual reality headset, the Vision Pro.  “When the device crashes, it switches to full passthrough and displays a warning to remove the device in 30 seconds so it can reboot. Pretty cool,” writes Ravichandran.       twitter     A Kernel exploit is a type of security vulnerability that targets the core component of an operating system. It manages system resources and provides essential services to other parts of the operating system and user applications.  In general, Kernel exploits are typically highly sought after by attackers because they allow unauthorized access to the system, execute malicious code with elevated privileges, or perform other malicious activities. Also, kernel exploits can be used to bypass security mechanisms, escalate privileges, or take control of the entire system.  Cybernews has contacted Ravichandran and Apple for a comment but has yet to receive a response.   Ravichandran is one of the researchers who previously identified the  PACMAN attack technique  that affects the Apple M1 central processing unit (CPU) to gain arbitrary code execution on Mac systems.   The post about the Kernel exploit comes shortly after Apple rolled out visionOS 1.0.2 software for the Apple Vision Pro headset  on January 31st . The updates were supposed to patch security vulnerabilities in the browser engine running Safari and other web applications. The same vulnerabilities were patched by the release of iOS 17.3 on other company devices – iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TVs.   The long-anticipated headset went on sale on February 2nd at a price starting at $3,499, more than thrice as much as the priciest headset in Meta's line of mixed and virtual reality devices. During  pre-sales , the company is estimated to have sold between 160,000 and 180,000 units.  A couple of days after the launch, the Apple Vision Pro took the internet by storm, with users  posting  how they were using the headset.

{"title": "Robot reported in hit-and-run incident", "published_date": "31 January 2024 ", "description": "A food delivery robot that allegedly crashed into a car and fled the crime scene was reported to the police in Finland.   The food delivery robot operated by the Finnish retail giant S Group has hit the parked car after losing control on a snow-covered sidewalk, according to Finland’s public broadcaster Yle.   The incident occurred over the weekend in capital Helsinki and was witnessed by a passer-by, who wished to remain anonymous. The robot was navigating an unplowed sidewalk and, reaching the edge of a snow pile, was ushered towards the car, where it got stuck, the witness said.     “Then it lurched back and forth against the side of the car, with the safety flag happily waving,” they told Yle, adding that both doors of the vehicle were scratched as a result.   The passerby said they lifted the helpless robot onto the roadway, but it fled the scene. Left with no other option, the witness notified emergency services about a “traffic incident.”   “The businesslike but amused emergency operator said he would notify the police. The police called, asked for identification and said that this incident was a career first,\" the witness was quoted as saying by  Yle .   S Group, which operates delivery robots across Finland, said it was investigating the incident.   Last year, a British man claimed  a Starship delivery robot  with “a mind of its own\" attacked him and his dog in Milton Keynes, a city north-west of London.

In a letter to affected individuals, the insurance brokerage stated that some personal information provided by customers was involved in a cybersecurity incident.  Keenan and Associates is one of the largest independent insurance brokerages in California.     The company claims to provide insurance and budgetary solutions to various sectors, including healthcare, education, and public organizations.   In the breach notice, the company disclosed that it accesses the personal information provided by its clients to perform certain operations.   The information accessed during the breach includes:    Name  Date of birth  Social Security number  Passport number  Driver’s license number  Health insurance information  General health information   On August 27th, 2023, the insurance company identified disruptions in several network servers.   The company claims to have launched an investigation and employed third-party cybersecurity and forensic experts to oversee the investigation.   Once detected, Keenan and Associates took measures to “contain” the breach and inform law enforcement.   The investigation determined that an unauthorized third party had infiltrated Keenan’s internal systems and gained access for six days.     Adversaries obtained personal information inside the system between August 21st and August 27th, 2023.

{"title": "Attack on Swedish datacenter shocks multiple businesses", "published_date": "24 January 2024 ", "description": "Cloud hosting service provider Tietoevry’s data centers in Sweden suffered a ransomware attack that could take weeks to mitigate. Several businesses were forced to close across the country.  The ransomware attack took place over the weekend and impacted several of Tietoevry‘s datacenters in Sweden, the company said in a statement.   “The attack was limited to one part of one of our Swedish datacenters, impacting Tietoevry’s services to some of our customers in Sweden,” the company said.    Several Tietoevry customers in Sweden suffered from the fallout of the attack.  For example, the Gardening store chain Granngården closed down its stores and stopped e-commerce activities, and the movie theater chain Filmstaden could not sell tickets.   Meanwhile, spirits monopoly chain Systembolaget, sports clothing chain Stadium, and domestic goods chain Rusta had their websites shut down due to the disruption.  “Considering the nature of the incident and the number of customer-specific systems to be restored, the restoration process may extend over several days, even weeks,” the company’s latest statement said.  The Finland-based company revealed that attackers used the Akira ransomware strain. However, we didn't find Tietoevry listed on Akira's dark web blog, where the gang typically posts its latest victims.  Recently, the gang made headlines after  attacking Nissan Oceania , the Japanese auto giant’s Australian and New Zealand businesses.  Tietoevry is a significant cloud hosting service provider, with €2.9 billion ($3.1 billion) revenue and staff exceeding 24,000.   Who is Akira ransomware?    Akira, a ransomware group discovered in March 2023, takes its name from a Japanese cyberpunk manga. According to Ransomlooker, a Cybernews tool that monitors the dark web, Akira has victimized 169 organizations in the US, Canada, and other countries.  The group follows a consistent modus operandi, demanding ransom payments ranging from $200,000 to $4 million. If these demands are not met, they resort to publishing compromised data online.  In July 2023, researchers at Avast, a cybersecurity firm,  released  a decryptor for the Akira ransomware used in several incidents. However, it only combats the Windows version of the ransomware. Akira also targets Linux-based systems with a specifically developed strain of malware.

{"title": "OpenAI’s Sam Altman in Davos: we will just have better tools", "published_date": "19 January 2024 ", "description": "Can technology amplify our humanity? OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, fresh off a leadership battle at the AI startup late last year, was asked this question at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.  Technology, especially the rise of generative artificial intelligence capabilities, is increasingly important for driving development and prosperity worldwide. However, the possible benefits are closely followed by risks, with responsible decision-making and job creation for people rather than machines as some stark examples.  Is it possible to move smoothly into the future with this hugely transformative technology? Altman, who is seemingly still on his AI regulation world tour, certainly thinks so and praises people for understanding “how it works.” This is despite OpenAI quietly  removing  the previous language in its usage policies that banned military and warfare uses of the company’s tools.    Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Altman said: “A very good sign about this new tool (generative AI) is that even with its very limited current capability and its very deep flaws, people are finding ways to use it for great productivity gains and understand the limitations.”  According to Altman, caring about what other humans think “seems very deeply wired into us,” and this will not change.   Chess, one of the first so-called victims of AI, is a good example. The Deep Blue supercomputer first beat then-world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.  “All of the commentators said, this is the end of chess. Now that a computer can beat a human, you know, no one's going to bother to watch chess again, ever. But chess has, I think, never been more popular than it is right now,” said Altman.  “If you cheat with AI, that's a big deal. And no one watches two AIs play each other. We're very interested in what other humans do. We're going to have better tools. We're still very focused on each other, and I think we will just do things with better tools.”  But what if the technology ends up in the hands of bad people with bad intentions? Altman said he had “a lot of empathy for the general nervousness and discomfort of the world towards companies” like OpenAI.    Sal Altman. Image by Shutterstock.   “I believe, and I think the world now believes, that the benefit here is so tremendous that we should go do this. But it is on us to figure out a way to get the input from society about how we're going to make these decisions, not only about what the values of the system are but also what the safety thresholds are and what kind of global coordination we need,” said Altman.    Earlier at the forum, Altman told Axios that he thought OpenAI's next big model \"will be able to do a lot, lot more\" than the existing models can. He also said AI was evolving much faster than previous technologies, and that is allegedly why \"uncomfortable\" decisions might be required.  OpenAI's technology is going to be customized individually, Altman said, and will probably give different users based on their value preferences and – possibly – on what country they reside in.  Altman was suddenly removed as OpenAI's CEO last November before being swiftly  returned to the role . The dispute was allegedly  caused  by tense internal debate over the company's mission, and after Altman's return, OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever resigned from the firm.  “When the board first asked me the day after firing me if I wanted to talk about coming back, my immediate response was no, because I was just very pissed about a lot of things about it. And then I quickly got to my senses and realized I didn't want to see all the value and all these wonderful people, who had put their lives into this, destroyed,” Altman revealed.

{"title": "UK government now on WhatsApp", "published_date": "22 January 2024 ", "description": "The UK government launches a WhatsApp channel to serve as a modern-day town crier.   More than 2,500 followers have joined the British government’s Whatsapp channel in an hour after it was announced on Monday (January 22nd).   “Hey WhatsApp,” the first message said, followed by a waving hand emoji. “We’ve arrived,” it declared.     “From now on, if there’s information you need to know from the UK government, we’ll WhatsApp you,” the announcement read.   A second message – a sticker of a town crier – was sent later. It showed Alan Myatt, holder of two Guinness World Records, announcing the launch of the new communication channel outside the Houses of Parliament in London.    According to the chat history, the channel was created on Thursday (January 18th) the previous week. Users can react to the announcements with emojis but cannot send their own messages, which is in line with WhatsApp Channels policy.   The channel is marked with a green verified account badge and members of the public can subscribe and unsubscribe from it at any time.   The government said the channel would amplify key messages like tax return deadlines, information on childcare support or cost of living payments. One of the first announcements will be sent to inform users of discounted rail tickets from the Great British Rail Sale, it said.  Cabinet Office Minister Alex Burghart said the government was looking forward to seeing how people respond to the new service and will develop it based on user feedback.     “We are always looking for new ways to communicate with the public. WhatsApp is a hugely popular platform in the UK so we hope our new and entirely opt-in WhatsApp channel will be a useful way of providing people with updates from the government,” Burghart said.   Helen Charles, who oversees WhatsApp’s public policy in Europe, said the new channel would “give people in the UK better access to reliable information through the most private broadcast service available.”  One recent study showed  WhatsApp  to be a middle-of-the-ground app when it comes to data privacy, doing better than two other Meta-owned platforms, Facebook and Instagram, but trailing Signal, one of its main rivals.   In 2022, WhatsApp featured in  a massive data leak , with 500 million user records reportedly put for sale online.

{"title": "Singing River breach exposes healthcare data of 250K+ individuals", "published_date": "15 January 2024 ", "description": "A ransomware attack against the Mississippi-based healthcare provider, which forced several hospitals to go offline and manually process patient care for several days, has exposed a trove of sensitive patient data.  Singing River started contacting individuals impacted by the August ransomware attack, severely affecting the US hospital system. According to the breach notification letter, which Singing River submitted to the Maine Attorney General, attackers roamed the company‘s systems for over 48 hours in late August of 2023.  “The investigation determined that the information potentially impacted may include your name, date of birth, address, Social Security number, medical information, and health information. We have no evidence that any of your information was used for identity theft or fraud,” the healthcare provider said.    Individual healthcare data can be sold for hundreds of dollars on dark web forums. For example, malicious actors can use medical details for medical identity theft, a type of fraud where threat actors use stolen information to submit forged claims to Medicare and other health insurers.  Meanwhile, other personally identifiable information (PII) may be used to commit fraud, from  identity theft  and  phishing attacks  to opening new credit accounts, making unauthorized purchases, or obtaining loans under false pretenses.  Data that the healthcare provider submitted to the authorities revealed that the attack exposed 252,890 individuals in total. Singing River said it would provide its impacted customers with credit monitoring and identity restoration services to mitigate potential issues if the exposed data was misused.   The Rhysida ransomware gang, which was behind the attack, breached several hospitals in the late summer of 2023. Three Singing River hospitals and a dozen medical clinics were affected. Its laboratory and radiology testing facilities were forced to work using paper-order tests and radiology exams due to the attack.   Who is Rhysida? According to US government officials who profiled the group  on November 15th, the ransomware gang hit the ransomware scene in late May.    The group, which is suspected to be made of veteran ransomware operators, made headlines with several high-profile attacks, including  the British Library  and Sony-owned video game maker  Insomniac .   The US Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) said Rhysida is known for going after “targets of opportunity,” including education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors.    Rhysida has also been observed operating as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) outfit, leasing out ransomware tools and infrastructure in a profit-sharing model.  According to Cybernews’ ransomware monitoring tool, Ransomlooker, Rhysida has publicly claimed nearly 50 organizations over the last 12 months.   Known to initially exploit its targets using social engineering to obtain valid credentials and escalate privileges via public-facing applications, the group often sets up live auctions on its dark leak site, offering up its victim’s data to the highest bidder.

{"title": "YouTube bans AI content that replicates deceased children", "published_date": "09 January 2024 ", "description": "YouTube will not allow content that “realistically simulates” deceased children or victims of violent crimes.   The video platform has updated its harassment and cyberbullying policy to ban content that “realistically simulates deceased minors or victims of deadly or well-documented major violent events describing their death or violence experienced.”   The updated policy will come into force on January 16th, Google, which owns YouTube, said.     It is part of its wider “responsibility efforts,” which previously included banning content about Covid-19 vaccines that contradicted consensus from health authorities and employing an algorithm to apply age restrictions to relevant videos.   The policy change comes after the proliferation of true crime videos on platforms like TikTok and YouTube recreating the likeness of dead or missing children narrating the stories of what happened to them.   Some of the videos used AI-generated depictions of James Bulger, a British two-year-old abducted and murdered in 1993, and Madeleine McCann, a three-year-old British girl who disappeared in Portugal in 2007.   Bulger’s mother described the AI clips of her son as “disgusting” and “beyond sick,” according to  The Mirror .   TikTok started removing such videos afterwards, stating that “our Community Guidelines are clear that we do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of a young person,” but many remained on YouTube.  Last year, YouTube started requiring creators  to label “synthetic” content  and warned that failing to do so could result in suspension or penalties. It also said creators and artists will be able to take down content that simulates their likeness without consent.

{"title": "Orange España suffers national outage caused by “ridiculously weak” password", "published_date": "05 January 2024 ", "description": "A major internet service disruption at Spanish telecommunications company Orange España was caused by a cyberattack that may not have occurred if the operator had used a stronger password.    On Wednesday, January 3rd, Orange users started complaining about having internet connection problems. The company confirmed a national outage on X, saying it had detected a widespread incident, which, “fortunately, has been detected very quickly, thanks in large part to all your comments and warnings.” The incident lasted for a few hours.   “The Orange account in the IP network coordination center (RIPE) has suffered improper access that has affected the browsing of some of our customers,” the company said.     However, the details of the cyberattack grabbed cybersecurity researchers' attention, who could not overlook the fact that weak password practices might have had a role.     twitter     A hacker on X with a newly created account named “Ms_Snow_OwO” posted screenshots, revealing how they hacked Orange’s RIPE NCC (Network Coordination Center) account using the password “ripeadmin.”   \"I've fixed the security of your RIPE administrator account. Send me a message to get the new credentials,\" they said. “I was just looking into public leaks of bot data and came across the ripe account with the password “ripeadmin” and no 2FA, no SE (social engineering) at all.”   The hacker even shared a video detailing how he was able to access and compromise the network.     twitter     The unauthorized access to RIPE, which manages regional IP addresses in Europe, had the potential to compromise Orange’s entire network. However, for some reason, the hackers only blocked certain domain name systems, which kept the effects limited,  El Pais reported . It’s unclear how Orange regained access to its systems.   Security researchers: “ridiculously weak” password to blame    Hudson Rock researchers investigated the email address that was used to access RIPE and identified that it is associated with the computer of an Orange Spain employee who was infected by an Infostealer earlier last year.   “Using the stolen account, the threat actor modified the AS number belonging to Orange’s IP address, resulting in major disruptions to Orange and a 50% loss in traffic,” researchers at Hudson Rock write.     Image by Hudson Rock.   The Orange employee had their computer infected by a Raccoon-type Infostealer on September 4th, 2023. Among the corporate credentials identified on the machine, the employee had specific credentials to “https://access.ripe.net” using the email address that was revealed by the threat actor ( [email protected] ), researchers noted.   “The password that was used on Orange’s RIPE administrator account was “ripeadmin” which is ridiculously weak,” the report reads. “This attack again illustrates how a single infostealer infection could be detrimental to any company. It is important to routinely check your organizational exposure to Infostealer infections, which are the top initial attack vector for threat actors to access corporate and customer accounts.”   Kevin Beaumont, author at Double Pulsar, noted that the two-step authentication was disabled, as RIPE doesn’t require it by default.   “Also, there is no sane password policy at RIPE – you can use borisjohnson as your password. In other words, it’s a powder keg,”  Beaumont said .   Doug Madory, director of Internet Analysis at security firm Kentik,  in his analysis , explains that the attacker, after gaining access to the RIPE account, began tinkering with publishing and revoking ROAs (Route Origin Authorization) for IP ranges belonging to the Spanish mobile operator. Fourteen minutes later, attackers published three new ROAs with material impact. Later, they took further steps by creating ROAs with origins other than that of Orange until the traffic started to take a nose dive at about 3:20 pm local.   Before 7 pm local, engineers from Spain’s second-largest mobile operator regained control of their RIPC NCC account and began publishing new ROAs that would enable the carrier to restore service.   “Although the outage is over, there is still a lot of clean-up work to be done,” Madory said and noted that thousands of routes that were still invalid.

{"title": "X platform back up after suffering weird outage early Thursday morning", "published_date": "21 December 2023 ", "description": "Social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, suffered outages globally early Thursday, according to Downdetector.com. Users couldn’t view posts on the platform for more than an hour.  Some users on X who were willing to post something could still do it. But they were unable to view posts on the social media site and only saw a message that said \"Welcome to X!\"  Another message, saying “Waiting for posts,” greeted users who encountered loading issues on X Pro, formerly TweetDeck.    Over 47,000 US users faced access issues with X and X Pro, according to Downdetector data. However, the outage was registered in other parts of the world as well – users in Canada, Britain, France, and other countries reported issues with accessing both X and X Pro    X outages were registered by Downdetector early Thursday morning. Image by Cybernews.   Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including users. Other global internet trackers at Netblocks also  noted  a “significant international outage” that wasn’t linked to any country-level blocks or filtering.  At about 1:30 AM ET, however, access to timelines was restored. But there was still no news about what might have caused the issue – emails to X’s notoriously unresponsive communications and support teams are bouncing back.  The social media platform faced upheaval and uncertainty following Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition, leading to layoffs, including numerous engineers responsible for fixing and preventing service outages, sources have previously told Reuters.  Users took to rival Meta's app, Threads, to discuss the outage, citing difficulties in accessing posts, replies and profiles on X.

{"title": "Apple to halt Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 sales in US", "published_date": "18 December 2023 ", "description": "Apple said on Monday that it will pause sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the United States starting this week, following an order from the US International Trade Commission (ITC) on a patent dispute pertaining to Apple Watch devices containing the Blood Oxygen feature.  In a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple explained that the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 will no longer be available to order from Apple’s website in the US after 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, December 21st. In-store inventory will no longer be available from Apple retail locations after December 24th.  Apple preemptively complies with the International Trade Commission (ITC) ban on imports of Apple Watches following a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo over its blood oxygen sensor.  Masimo, a medical device company, has accused Apple of infringing on its pulse oximetry patents and filed a lawsuit in California Federal Court and requested an injunction from the ITC. The ITC found that Apple's devices  violate Masimo's patent rights.    A presidential review period on the feature is in progress.  US President Joe Biden has until December 25 to review the order. However, vetos of ITC import bans have been rare.  Apple is preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand, the company confirmed to Reuters.  Both the Series 9 and the Ultra 2 would remain available for purchase outside of the United States and there would be no impact on units previously bought that include the blood oxygen feature.  Apple believes the ITC's finding was erroneous and should be reversed and intends to appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit.  Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.  A jury trial on Masimo's allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in a federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo's legal actions a \"maneuver to clear a path\" for its own competing smartwatch.  A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama's administration overturned an import ban on Apple's iPhones and iPads from a patent dispute with Samsung.  The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.  Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.

{"title": "GambleForce threat group targets Asia-Pacific", "published_date": "14 December 2023 ", "description": "From gambling to government websites, the Asia-Pacific region is under attack by a new threat actor, which has been spotted going after a wide range of targets to steal their data. Cybersecurity analyst Group-IB says it disabled the gang’s command and control center but expects it to regroup.  Dubbed GambleForce by the cybersecurity analyst, the gang uses structured query language (SQL) injection attacks, an old faithful in the cybercrime arsenal, to siphon off sensitive data. But what it does with that data, Group-IB’s investigators have been unable to determine so far.    What does seem beyond doubt is that GambleForce is not picky when it comes to selecting targets. Two dozen entities in the government, gambling, retail, travel, and jobseeking sectors have found themselves in the firing line across Asian-Pacific countries, including Australia, China, India, and South Korea.  The group uses open-source – in other words, freely available – digital tools, including the much-misused  Cobalt Strike  to launch its SQL injection attacks, which occur when deliberately contaminated data is sent to a target system as part of a seemingly routine query to trick it into allowing further data to be accessed without proper authorization.  Despite the basic nature of such attacks, GambleForce appears to have enjoyed some success since appearing on the scene in September, until Group-IB’s emergency response team knocked out its server and effectively disabled its operations.  “In some instances, the attackers stopped after performing reconnaissance,” added Group-IB. “In other cases, they successfully extracted user databases containing logins and hashed [i.e., protected] passwords, along with lists of tables from accessible databases.”  It added: “Rather than looking for specific data, the threat actor attempts to exfiltrate any available piece of information within targeted databases, such as hashed and plain text user credentials. What the group does with the stolen data remains unknown so far.”  Group-IB says it believes GambleForce will return before long to continue its campaign. It has already been spotted further afield during one attack on a target in Brazil that sought to exploit a vulnerability in the open-source content management system Joomla.   In that case, the cyberattack failed to extract any data, but  Group-IB  says it’s only a matter of time before the gang rearms.  “We believe that GambleForce is most likely to regroup and rebuild their infrastructure before long and launch new attacks,” it said.

The streaming giant said its next live sports event, called  The Netflix Slam , is scheduled for Sunday, March 3rd, 2024.   Rafael Nadal, 22-time Grand Slam men’s singles title champion, will face a fellow Spaniard, World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in a special match that will take place in Michelob ULTRA Arena at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, in Las Vegas.     The stream will target both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking markets, broadcasting in both languages, according to Netflix. While the duel between Nadal and Alcaraz is marketed as a one-off, the company said it plans more matches between additional players.   “I’m very excited for my first visit to Las Vegas, one of the most iconic and entertaining cities in the world,” Nadal said in a statement. “I’m also very excited to be playing with my fellow countryman Carlos Alcaraz. I am sure it will be a fantastic night of tennis.”  Meanwhile, Alcaraz said he was “honored and so happy” to share the court with Nadal in Las Vegas.   “He’s an all-time great, of course, and his records and achievements speak for themselves. Rafa also is one of the nicest guys on Tour and I look forward to our match,” he said.   Tickets to see the show in the arena will go on sale to the public Friday, December 15th, with prices starting at $88, Netflix said.  This is the second time Netflix will broadcast a live sports event. The live broadcast of  The Netflix Cup  saw Formula 1 drivers paired with PGA Tour golfers in an eight-hole match at the Wynn Las Vegas  golf course .   The first live broadcast on Netflix was a stand-up  comedy special  from Chris Rock and took place in March this year. In July, there was also a live reunion of the Season 3 cast of  Love Is Blind: Brazil , and  The 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards  live event is scheduled for February.

{"title": "German Energy Agency latest claimed by ALPHV/BlackCat ransom gang", "published_date": "07 December 2023 ", "description": "Dena, the Deutsche Energie-Agentur GmbH – translated in English to the German Energy Agency LTD – is being claimed as the latest casualty of the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group.   The Berlin-based profit-oriented climate protection agency announced it had been the victim of a cyberattack on November 23rd.   The international energy think tank has roughly 100 energy transition projects currently happening around the world,  with 2022 earnings listed as over  €700 million .     Dena posted a statement on its website with details about the attack and the ongoing investigation.   “As a result of the cyber attack on dena, a risk to the data processed by our business contacts cannot be ruled out,” dena said.   “This may also affect sensitive data, such as account details,” it said, adding forensic experts were still determining “exactly which data was leaked.”    dena.de. Image by Cybernews.   Meanwhile, at about 2 p.m. EST Wednesday, December 6th, ALPHV/BlackCat   posted dena on its dark leak site.   In a short blog entry, the Russian-linked gang claimed to have stolen sensitive data from the energy collective, but did not provide any specific amount.   A list of stolen data was stated to be “encrypted backups, esxi, unloaded all email correspondence as of 2016 and other sensitive data.”     ALPHV/BlackCat leak site. Image by Cybernews     It also appears that dena was forced to take its systems offline to try and contain the damage, which is often the case with cyberattacks.   “We will only restart our systems once this review has been completed and additional protective measures have been introduced,” dena said in its breach announcement.   The company declined to provide exactly when that would be, but said it would post any updates on its website.     dena.de. Image by Cybernews.   The company also said it would be reviewing its entire IT infrastructure to ensure the “greatest possible security” for the company and business partners.  Cybernews has reached out to dena and is awaiting a response.  Who is ALPHV/BlackCat? ALPHV/BlackCat  ransomware was first observed in 2021 and is known to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model by selling malware subscriptions to criminals.  The Russian-affiliated gang carried out more than 200 ransom attacks in the first half of 2023 alone, according to a  September report  by Trend Micro, and is said to be  responsible  for approximately 12% of all attacks in 2022.  The group has easily caused over $1 billion in lost corporate revenue in 2023, according to security insiders.  Known for its triple-extortion tactics, the gang was responsible for the September ransomware attacks on the Las Vegas casino giants  MGM Resorts , as well as  Caesars International , who is rumored to have paid a $15 million ransom to keep operations running.    Other big name victims include  Clorox ,  Dole ,  NCR ,  Next Gen Healthcare ,  Seiko  and the  Mazars Group .

{"title": "AI models wide open to cyberattacks, analyst warns", "published_date": "04 December 2023 ", "description": "HuggingFace and GitHub developer platforms may be essential for the development of AI technologies – but they’re also leaving top-level organization accounts from Google, Meta, Microsoft, and WMWare exposed to threat actors.  That’s the shocking reveal from researchers at Lasso Security, who insisted that “the gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.”    Launching its investigation in November, Lasso Security inspected hundreds of application protocol interfaces (APIs) on both expertise-sharing platforms to reach its startling conclusion. APIs are used to allow applications in computing to ‘talk’ to each other and are, therefore, a cornerstone of IT development.  Facebook owner Meta was found to be particularly vulnerable, with its large-language Llama learning model being exposed in many cases. But it was by no means the only LLM research workshop found to be critically vulnerable.  “Notably, our investigation led to the revelation of a significant breach in the supply chain infrastructure, exposing high-profile accounts of Meta,” researchers said. “The ramifications of this breach are far-reaching, as we successfully attained full access, both read and write permissions, to Meta Llama2, BigScience Workshop, and EleutherAI.”  Between them, the compromised parties own models with millions of downloads – leaving them all “susceptible to potential exploitation by malicious actors.”  “The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated,” said the researchers. “With control over an organization boasting millions of downloads, we now possess the capability to manipulate existing models, potentially turning them into malicious entities.”  In what it claims adds up to “a dire threat,” the report says the injection of these corrupted models with malware “could affect millions of users who rely on these foundational models for their applications.”  A key vulnerability in the HuggingFace API setup is the facility provided to developers who need to integrate models, reading, creating, modifying, or deleting repositories and files as needed. Unfortunately, it would appear that this tool can be exploited by a malicious hacker.  “These HuggingFace API tokens are highly significant for organizations and exploiting them could lead to major negative outcomes such as data breaches, malicious models spreading, and more,” researchers said.    The analyst had hoped that its investigation of Hugging Face and GitHib would help shed light on any security measures developers needed to take to protect LLMs against potential threats – now it looks as though those measures will need to be stringent indeed.  “The implications extend beyond mere model manipulation,” said Lasso Security. “Our research also granted us access to 14 datasets with tens of thousands of downloads. Alarming as it is, this opens the door to a malicious technique known as training data poisoning.”  What that means is that by tampering with trusted datasets, attackers could compromise the integrity of machine learning models, “leading to widespread consequences.”  Researchers say they reached out to all concerned parties, who promptly responded to its alert. Hugging Face, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and VMWare followed its advice by revoking or deleting the exposed API tokens, in many cases on the same day as the disclosure was made.  To prevent further such occurrences and forestall data poisoning or theft, Lasso Security recommends that tokens used in LLM development are strictly classified from now on, with cybersecurity solutions put in place that are tailored specifically to these models.  “In addition to classification, frequent monitoring and verifying the integrity of datasets, ensuring that they remain untampered,” Lasso Security added. “By promptly addressing these issues, organizations can fortify their defenses and avert the looming threats posed by these security vulnerabilities.”           More from Cybernews:  Navigating the shadows: the risks of AI-generated content      Spot the Artist: a robot dog takeover at NGV Triennial in Melbourne    Spotify to cut staff by 17%   Roblox, Twitch allegedly targeted by ransomware cartel    WhatsApp takes user privacy to next level: secrecy     Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "Instagram trickster jailed after stealing $740K", "published_date": "28 November 2023 ", "description": "A Los Angeles con artist has been jailed for eight years after using SIM-swapping techniques to hijack Instagram accounts and rob hundreds of victims by duping them into sending him money.  Though individual losses rarely amounted to more than $500, the Department of Justice (DoJ) expressed satisfaction at the tough sentencing imposed on Amir Hossein Golshan, 25, who defrauded hundreds of people between 2019 and 2023 out of around $740,000 in total.    “He showed little remorse for his victims or being caught during his years of crime, believing that he could hide behind the anonymity of online screen names or VPNs and that his victims – who were on the other side of the computer – would never find him,” said prosecutors during a discussion of sentencing.   They added: “Indeed, the defendant continued to commit these crimes, becoming more sophisticated and brazen in his actions, up until the FBI arrested him.”  The sophistication of Golshan’s ruse lay in a combination of many moving parts – first using the SIM-swapping trick to dupe mobile phone providers into reassigning contact numbers to his control. This allowed him to launch social media account takeovers that targeted both primary victims and their friends.  On average, victims lost between $300 and $500, but in one case, Golshan took his game-hunting up a notch, impersonating a friend of an Instagram influencer with more than 100,000 followers in December 2021 to defraud her and others out of thousands of dollars between them via Zelle, PayPal, and other legal online payment platforms.  His ingenuity didn’t end there. Golshan also impersonated Apple Support employees so he could illegally access iCloud accounts and steal digital art non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrency.  In another case cited by the DoJ, Golshan contacted a victim in August 2022, making it look like he was using Apple Support’s legitimate telephone number to heighten the deception. He convinced the victim to part with their personal code, ironically claiming that this was intended to provide them with “an advanced security protocol” to shore up their digital safety.  This got Golshan into the victim’s iCloud account, where he could then change the email address registered to it to one he controlled. After that, he was able to steal an NFT worth $319,000 and $70,000 in cryptocurrency from the same victim.  Golshan entered a guilty plea in July after being taken into federal custody the previous month, which the DoJ says was prompted by his violation of the terms of his pretrial release.

{"title": "Tri Counties Bank breach exposes user financial data", "published_date": "23 November 2023 ", "description": "Tri Counties Bank, serving primarily the US West Coast, has had its systems breached. Attackers took personal customer and employee data, including financial information.  The bank has started informing impacted individuals about a data breach after attackers penetrated its systems in February 2023. According to the letter, the attack exposed names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver’s license numbers, and financial account information.  The victims include some of Tri Counties Bank’s customers, employees, their affiliates, and dependents. Information the bank submitted to the Maine Attorney General says a total of 74,385 individuals were impacted by the attack.    The breach notification letter to the hack’s victims says that Tri Counties Bank’s “network had been infected with malware which prevented access to certain files on its network,” strongly pointing to a ransomware attack.  Even though the attack took place in early February, the bank said it completed a review of potentially impacted data only in October, eight months after attackers breached its systems.  The bank’s breach notification letter somewhat downplays the attacks’ impact, saying that the bank “has no evidence of any identity theft or fraud in connection with this incident.”  The bank said it had informed law enforcement agencies about the breach and vouched to provide the attack victims with “identity restoration and guidance on how to better protect against identity theft and fraud.”           More from Cybernews: What kind of cyberattacks are expected this Black Friday and Cyber Monday?

{"title": "Ukraine’s top two cybersecurity officials axed amid embezzlement probe", "published_date": "21 November 2023 ", "description": "Two heads of Ukraine’s national cybersecurity agency were fired Monday amid accusations they took part in an interagency embezzlement scheme involving millions in public funds.  Senior cyber defense officials at the  State Service Of Special Communications And Information Protection Of Ukraine (SSSCIP),   Yury Shchygol and Viktor Zhora, were fired by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Monday morning.   The SSSCIP is responsible for securing government communications and defending the state from cyber attacks.     The move comes barely an hour after the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) launched an investigation into an alleged embezzlement scheme at the agency involving state funds.   Taras Melnychuk, a senior cabinet official, posted the news on Telegram.      NABU announced that it was investigating  Shchygol  and Zhora’s connection to a six-person fraud scheme that bilked roughly 62 million Ukrainian hryvnia ($1.72 M) in public funds between 2020 and 2022.  The two are suspected of purposefully overpaying for software from two companies and pocketing the difference. Part of the scheme involved rigging the bidding process for other competing companies.   Zhora posted his own  statement  on X and avoided mentioning the investigations “in the interests of the entire Service.” Instead, he thanked his colleagues and others he had worked with over his tenure for their support.   The former security head said his one regret was that he did not “have time to launch the national bug bounty, we didn't manage to pass the draft law 8087, which is extremely necessary for the state, didn't manage to legislate the Cyber Forces, despite the laid foundations for their creation.”  In the near future, I plan to decide how I can best be useful to the Armed Forces, he concluded.       twitter     Shchyhol posted on Facebook he was confident he could prove his innocence, Interfax Ukraine reported.  In a statement on its website Monday, the  SSSCIP  said it has been compliant with NABU, providing investigators with “all the necessary information” and would continue to do so, also denying allegations against the agency.   “The SSSCIP’s operation is based on the principles of openness and zero toleration of corruption,” it said.   “Since 2020, all the SSSCIP's procurements have been in line with legislation in force. Procurements in the area of state registers protection are complex, their analysis requires training and grasp,” it said.   Furthermore, the agency urged abstaining from accusations until the investigation is completed.   Some reports say the firings are also part of a broader sweep, considered standard procedure when a head of ministry changes.    The former Head of Ukraine’s Defense Ministry,  Oleksii Reznikov , resigned in September after a series of corruption scandals had plagued the ministry, as reported by the Kyiv Post. His successor,  Rustem Umerov , took over the position last month.   Dmytro Vasyliovych Makovsky has been assigned as interim head of the SSSCIP.

{"title": "Toyota Financial Services attack claimed by Medusa ransomware", "published_date": "17 November 2023 ", "description": "Toyota Financial Services (TFS), the Japanese automakers’ vehicle financing and leasing subsidiary, was recently hit by a disruptive cyberattack. The Medusa ransomware gang has just taken responsibility for it.  Earlier this week, TFS Europe & Africa said the company “identified unauthorized activity on systems,” which forced the company to take some systems offline.  “We are working diligently to get systems back online as soon as possible, and we regret any inconvenience caused to our customers and business partners,” TFS said, adding that the incident is limited to Europe & Africa.    While the company did not identify the nature of the attack, TFS was likely hit with ransomware, as it‘s been listed on the dark web leak site that Medusa uses to showcase its latest victims.    Toyota Financial Services posted on Medusa's blog. Image by Cybernews.   We’ve contacted the TFS European branch but the company did not want to comment anything past what was already said in the official statement.   \"The security of personal information and the protection of our customers is a priority for TFS, and at this time, our investigation is ongoing,\" TFS told Cybernews.  The attackers claim to have breached TFS’s Germany branch. The gang included data supposedly taken from TFS servers, such as leasing contracts, email addresses, usernames and passwords, passport details, and other sensitive data.  TFS is a financial subsidiary of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the world’s largest automaker. TFS handles auto loans, leases, and other financial services to Toyota customers in every continent.  Medusa‘s dark web blog post suggests that the gang demands $8 million to delete the data allegedly stolen from TFS.  Earlier this week, Medusa said it had hit the prominent Canadian fintech  Moneris . However, the company told Cybernews that the attackers had only “attempted” an attack and did not succeed.    The Medusa ransomware gang began operating around the end of 2022 and has been consistently active. According to  Ransomlooker , a Cybernews ransomware monitoring tool, Medusa has attacked at least 119 organizations over the past 12 months.

And the challenges created by the rise of generative AI, fake videos, and misinformation are too great for us not to meet head-on,” wrote McMahon.  To make the unit work, the CEO plans to hire forensic journalists, expand training, and invest in new technologies. As claimed in a memo, job postings will be released in the upcoming days.   The new unit will be led by Claudia Milne – senior vice president for CBS News and head of standards and practices – and Ross Dagan, executive vice president and head of news operations and transformation for CBS News.

{"title": "Sun Life third-party breach exposes 212K individuals", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Sun Life data was exposed after MOVEit hackers breached Pension Benefit Information (PBI), jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of individuals.  Sun Life, a financial services company managing a trillion dollars worth of assets, informed the Maine Attorney General that a third-party breach had impacted 212,129 individuals.  Earlier this year, the company was impacted by the infamous MOVEit attacks after hackers breached Sun Life’s third-party vendor, PBI.  PBI’s hack  exposed several companies, including  Prudential ,  New York Life ,  Colorado State University ,  CalPERS , and others.    According to information Sun Life submitted to the Maine Attorney General, individuals’ Social Security numbers (SSNs) were exposed in the attack.  Losing SSNs poses significant risks, as impersonators can use stolen data with names and driver’s license numbers for  identity theft .  Sun Life said that all affected individuals were offered two years of complimentary credit monitoring services.  Sun Life is a Canadian financial services company primarily known for life insurance services. The business employs around 50,000 staff and reported revenue exceeding $17 billion in 2022.  Earlier this year, the Cl0p ransomware cartel exploited a  zero-day bug in the MOVEit Transfer  software, which allowed attackers to access and download data stored there.  According to researchers at Emsisoft, over 2,500 organizations – mainly in the US – and over 66 million individuals have been impacted by MOVEit attacks by the Russia-linked ransomware cartel.  Taking IBM’s estimate, which puts the cost of an average data breach at $165 per leaked record, the impact of the Cl0p attacks would add up to a staggering $10.7 billion.

{"title": "800m Indians reportedly exposed in massive data breach", "published_date": "12 December 2023 ", "description": "Highly sensitive personal information belonging to more than 800 million Indians is being offered online for $80,000, according to a US security firm.   Over half of more than 1.4 billion people in the world’s most populous nation may have been affected by the alleged breach, which could be India’s biggest if confirmed.   The US-based cybersecurity company Resecurity said it had identified millions of personal information records belonging to Indian residents on sale on the dark web in early October.     The personal data offered online reportedly includes Aadhaar biometric ID cards and passport information, as well as names, phone numbers, and addresses.   Aadhaar is the world’s largest biometric ID system, with an estimated number of 1.4 billion cards issued by government authorities since the program’s launch in 2009. The cards hold biometric information such as fingerprints and iris scans.   Both citizen and non-citizen residents of India can be issued an Aadhaar card, which is voluntary but can function as a digital ID for online payments. There are also plans to link it with voter registration, and 60% of India’s 945 million eligible voters have already done so.   According to Indian media reports, the data was extracted from COVID-19 test details of citizens registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s leading medical research institution.  As reported by  The Hindu , a Chennai-based daily, the ICMR has faced multiple cyberattacks since February. In June, a Telegram chat allowed people to fetch entries from the CoWIN vaccination portal’s database, potentially leading to the Aadhaar or passport number leak, it  said .   At the time, India’s government denied reports of the leak, which experts described as potentially one of the country’s worst digital security breaches. The episode is reportedly being probed.   Resecurity said it had already observed a spike in incidents involving Aadhaar IDs and warned that it created a “ significant risk ” of digital identity theft, with the potential to leverage the stolen information in cyber-enabled financial crimes, such as online banking or tax refund frauds.

{"title": "Controversial Online Safety Bill is now UK law", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "The UK government’s controversial Online Safety Bill has finally become an official law. Critics and tech firms say that the document is dangerous, but others think more action is needed.  The Act’s provisions force tech companies to take responsibility for the content they host on their platforms.   The law also gives the UK government the power to force internet companies to remove child sexual abuse material, online scams, anonymous trolls, deepfakes, and other content that the government deems illegal.     Companies that fail to act on the government's requests will face fines of up to £18 million ($22 million), or 10% of their global annual turnover. Tech executives could also face prison time under certain circumstances.  Government “immensely proud” The  Act  forces tech firms to protect children from material that might be legal but still deemed harmful. It also now requires pornography sites to stop children from viewing content by checking ages more thoroughly than before.  New offenses have also been created, such as cyber-flashing – sending unsolicited sexual imagery online – and the sharing of deepfake pornography where AI is used to apply someone’s likeness into pornographic material. The law is explained in more detail  here .  “Today will go down as an historic moment that ensures the online safety of British society not only now, but for decades to come. I am immensely proud of the work that has gone into the Online Safety Act from its very inception to it becoming law today,”  said  the UK’s Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan.  “The Bill protects free speech, empowers adults, and will ensure that platforms remove illegal content.”    The government said in August that the regulator Ofcom would only ask tech firms to access messages once \"feasible technology\" had been developed.    Tech companies aren’t happy – mostly because of, in their view, unrealistic demands to prevent illegal content from appearing on their platforms rather than removing it. According to the firms, this means scanning even encrypted messages before they’re actually garbled.    Scanning encrypted messages? This suggestion has already received serious criticism from security experts, as being both unworkable and a threat to privacy and security.  Meta’s WhatsApp, Signal , and other similar apps that use end-to-end encryption – which protects messages from being seen by people outside the chat – have previously threatened to leave the UK if they’re forced to enable scanning.  Last year, Meta  said  that the Online Safety Bill “risks people’s private messages being constantly surveilled and censored.”  “You can’t scan encrypted messages while preserving encryption. End-to-end encryption either protects everything or protects nothing. There’s no way for the government to scan an end-to-end encrypted message without breaking it and putting everyone under threat of hacks and surveillance,” Andy Yen, the CEO of Proton, a mail platform focusing on privacy, also  wrote  in an op-ed last month.  However, the government said in August that the regulator Ofcom would only ask tech firms to access messages once \"feasible technology\" had been developed. This appears to have been a sort of a climb-down, and the solution was cautiously welcomed by campaigners and tech leaders.  Some say that more needs to be done. Adenike Cosgrove, a cybersecurity strategist at Proofpoint, an American cybersecurity company, says more laws have to be passed to ensure that all platforms comply with the Online Safety Act.  “It will be difficult for social media platforms to identify and remove all harmful content especially where criminals masquerade as legitimate people on dating apps, building relationships with people and often then asking them to move to another platform to continue the conversation,” said Cosgrove.  “With this in mind, we must weigh the potential benefits of the bill against the potential risks and to ensure that it is implemented in a way that both protects user safety and privacy.”      More from Cybernews: Hello Alfred app exposes user data  Experts name essential skills to beat the robot takeover  Microsoft: English-speaking ransom gang issuing death threats  Western Digital, Japan's Kioxia call off merger talks  MGM ransom gang hits Marriott, Hilton hotel management group LBA Hospitality  Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "Fake Amazon and Microsoft call centers busted", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "In a nationwide crackdown against cybercrime, Indian authorities raided 76 illegal call centers impersonating Amazon and Microsoft tech support.   The operation, called Chakra-II, was carried out by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) with help from Amazon and Microsoft, both companies confirmed in separate statements.   The raids took place in multiple locations in at least 11 states, according to the CBI. It said that it confiscated 32 mobile phones, 48 laptops and hard disks, images of two servers, 33 SIM cards and various pen drives.     Numerous bank accounts were also frozen and 15 email accounts seized, “illuminating the intricate web of deceit spun by the accused,” the CBI said.   It did not mention the number of arrests made during the operation. The illegal call centers impacted more than 2,000 Amazon and Microsoft customers primarily based in the US, but also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and the UK.   Amazon and Microsoft supported the operation by making a joint criminal referral, which marks the first time the two companies have collaborated to combat tech support fraud.   “The joint referral enabled the exchange of actionable intelligence and insights with CBI and other international law enforcement agencies to help them take action at scale,” Microsoft said.   “We firmly believe that partnerships like these are not only necessary but pivotal in creating a safer online ecosystem and in extending our protective reach to a larger number of individuals,” it said.   For its own part, Amazon said: “Together, the companies are setting a precedent for the power of industry collaboration and the collective impact it can have in holding bad actors accountable.”  “Amazon will remain vigilant and persistent in our efforts to stay one step ahead of fraudsters, but we cannot win this fight alone. We encourage others in the industry to join us as a united front against criminal activity.”   According to the FBI, call center fraud cost victims more than $1 billion in losses last year in the US alone, with fraudsters overwhelmingly targeting the elderly. Almost half the victims reported to be over 60 and accounted for 69%, or over $724 million, of losses.    The scams primarily emanate from South Asia, with India being the hotbed of call center fraud, according to the FBI.

{"title": "X becomes first platform to be fined under Australia’s Online Safety Act", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "An Australian regulator has fined Elon Musk's social media platform X AUD$610,500 (USD$386,000) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.  This is a blow to a company that has struggled to keep advertisers onboard amid complaints that it's going soft on moderating content.  The e-Safety Commission fined X, the platform Musk rebranded from Twitter, saying it failed to respond to questions including how long it took to respond to reports of child abuse material on the platform and the methods it used to detect it.    Though small compared to the $44 billion Musk paid for the website in October 2022, the fine is a reputational hit for a company that has seen a continuous revenue decline as advertisers cut spending on a platform that has stopped most content moderation and reinstated thousands of banned accounts.  Most recently, the EU  said  it was investigating X for potential violation of its new tech rules after the platform was accused of failing to rein in disinformation in relation to Hamas's attack on Israel.  \"If you've got answers to questions, if you're actually putting people, processes, and technology in place to tackle illegal content at scale and globally, and if it's your stated priority, it's pretty easy to say,\" Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in an interview.  \"The only reason I can see to fail to answer important questions about illegal content and conduct happening on platforms would be if you don't have answers,\" added Inman Grant, who was a public policy director for X until 2016.  X closed its Australian office after Musk's buyout, so there was no local representative to respond to Reuters. A request for comment sent to the San Francisco-based company's media email address was not immediately answered.  Under Australian laws that took effect in 2021, the regulator can compel internet companies to give information about their online safety practices or face a fine. If X refuses to pay the fine, the regulator can pursue the company in court, Grant said.  After taking the company private, Musk said in a post that \"removing child exploitation is priority #1\". But the Australian regulator  said  that when it asked X how it prevented child grooming on the platform, X responded that it was \"not a service used by large numbers of young people.\"  X told the regulator available anti-grooming technology was \"not of sufficient capability or accuracy to be deployed on Twitter\".    Inman Grant said the commission also issued a warning to Alphabet's Google for noncompliance with its request for information about the handling of child abuse content, calling the search engine giant's responses to some questions \"generic.\" Google said it had cooperated with the regulator and was disappointed by the warning.  \"We remain committed to these efforts and collaborating constructively and in good faith with the e-Safety Commissioner, government, and industry on the shared goal of keeping Australians safer online,\" said Google's director of government affairs and public policy for Australia, Lucinda Longcroft.  X's noncompliance was more serious, the regulator said, including failure to answer questions about how long it took to respond to reports of child abuse, the steps it took to detect child abuse in livestreams, and its numbers of content moderation, safety, and public policy staff.  The company confirmed to the regulator that it had cut 80% of its workforce globally and has no public policy staff in Australia, compared to two before Musk's takeover.  X told the regulator its proactive detection of child abuse material in public posts dropped after Musk took the company private.  The company told the regulator it did not use tools to detect the material in private messages because \"the technology is still in development\", the regulator said.

{"title": "Fiserv attack exposes 837K Flagstar Bank clients", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Flagstar Bank’s vendor, the financial technology giant Fiserv, has fallen victim to the MOVEit Transfer attacks, exposing the personal details of hundreds of thousands of the bank’s customers.  Another US-based company has entered the ever-growing list of MOVEit Transfer attacks carried out by the Russia-linked ransomware cartel Cl0p.  Flagstar contacted impacted individuals, saying that attackers have accessed their data via Fiserv, a company that the bank “uses for payment processing and mobile banking purposes.” Fiserv, like thousands of other companies, employed the MOVEit Transfer software.    “[…] the unauthorized activity in the MOVEit Transfer environment occurred between May 27th and 31st, 2023, which was before the existence of this vulnerability was publicly disclosed. During that time, unauthorized actors obtained our vendor files transferred via MOVEit. These files included Flagstar Bank and related institution customer information, including yours,” reads the breach notification.  According to information that Flagstar Bank provided to the Maine Attorney General, 837,390 individuals were impacted by the attack. As a result of the attack, threat actors may have accessed customer Social Security numbers (SSNs).  Losing SSNs poses significant risks, as impersonators can use stolen data in tandem with names and details for  identity theft .  To assist victims, Flagstar Bank will offer a complimentary identity monitoring service. Impacted individuals are also advised to remain vigilant and regularly review and monitor their credit history.  MOVEit Transfer attacks Earlier this year, Cl0p exploited a now-patched zero-day bug in Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer software, which  allowed attackers  to access and download the data stored there.  So far, over 2,100 organizations and over 62 million people are confirmed to have been impacted by the MOVEit Transfer attacks.  The Russia-linked gang Cl0p goes by a few different names. People in the cyber industry know the syndicate as TA505, Lace Tempest, Dungeon Spider, and FIN11. The gang is quite old, having been first observed back in 2019.    Numerous well-known organizations have had their clients exposed in the MOVEit attacks. For example, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), a Sony branch responsible for developing PlayStation consoles, said that thousands of its former employees  had their data exposed .  Other named victims include American Airlines,  TJX  off-price department stores,  TomTom, Pioneer Electronics, Autozone ,  Johns Hopkins  University and Health System, Warner Bros Discovery, AMC Theatres, Choice Hotels’  Radisson Americas  chain, and  Crowe  accounting advisory firm.

{"title": "Ahead of 2024, Musk’s X cuts its election integrity staff", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "The 2024 elections, when Americans will once again choose their president, is just around the corner, but Elon Musk has abruptly cut staff from his X team that combats election disinformation.  The Information was the  first  to report that X, formerly known as Twitter, got rid of half of the global election integrity team, and Musk soon  confirmed  the news on X. He stated: “Oh you mean the ‘Election Integrity’ Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.”  Even though the said team now has fewer than ten staff members, there’s still time, however, as the 2024 US presidential election is over a year away. And, of course, the scale of impact that X, actually a mid-sized social media platform, has on any huge election campaign should not be overstated.    Nevertheless, the latest move is a bit bizarre as X had announced in a  blog post  at the end of August that it was expanding its “safety and elections teams to focus on combating manipulation, surfacing inauthentic accounts and closely monitoring the platform for emerging threats.”  Besides, X’s chief executive Linda Yaccarino recently  told  the Financial Times that the platform was aiming to expand its elections and trust and safety teams by hiring more staff ahead of major elections in 2024.  Just last week, the European Union  advised  Musk to take better care in fighting disinformation and comply with new laws on fake news and propaganda. This kind of content is now deemed illegal across the EU under the Digital Services Act, which came into force in August.  In a  fresh report , X was found to have the highest ratio of disinformation posts of all large social media platforms.  Another  review  by NewsGuard, an anti-misinformation outfit – found that engagement “soared” by 70% for Russian, Chinese, and Iranian disinformation sources after Musk, who bought the app in 2022, removed labels from state-run propaganda accounts.  After acquiring the platform in late 2022, Musk immediately slashed its workforce from around 7,500 employees to fewer than 2,000 after a series of job cuts. That number keeps shrinking.  X – which relies on ads for the majority of its income – also has to deal with an advertising boycott of the company by several major firms. They are worried about X’s approach to content moderation.  Musk himself has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and says he’s keen to allow a broader range of voices on X. To him, all speech is of equal merit and deserving to be platformed – including speech that incites hatred and violence or is pure state propaganda and disinformation.

{"title": "FTC sues Amazon for operating unlawful online retail monopoly", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "The US Federal Trade Commission filed suit against Amazon.com, claiming the massive shopping platform has been using a multitude of shady tactics to strategically control the online marketplace, leading to an anti-competitive monopoly of power against its rivals.  The FTC filed the lawsuit Tuesday in the Western District Court of Washington, along with 17 US State Attorney General's offices.   “A single company, Amazon, has seized control over much of the online retail economy,” the 172-page  complaint  said.     Labeling the online retail and technology giant a “monopolist,” the lawsuit accuses Amazon of exploiting tens of millions of customers who shop on the platform, as well as the thousands of businesses who sell to them.   T he anti-trust and consumer protection agency listed  a plethora of illegal conduct Amazon had engaged in during the four-year investigation, charging the online retailer of stifling both competition and   innovation  across a huge swath of the online economy.   “Amazon… uses its power to hike prices on American shoppers and charge sky-high fees on hundreds of thousands of online sellers,” said John Newman, Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.   “Seldom in the history of US antitrust law has one case had the potential to do so much good for so many people,” Newman said.     twitter     Some of the more egregious actions Amazon is accused of include overcharging sellers, degrading quality for shoppers, preventing rivals sellers from lowering prices, and biasing the platform’s online search results.   For example, Amazon seller fees range from advertising fees to monthly charges for each item sold – adding up to nearly 50% of a seller's profit paid to the online shopping behemoth.   Furthermore, the lawsuit states that sellers were often punished by Amazon for offering lower prices on similar Amazon brand products by “burying the other products so far down on Amazon’s search results that they become effectively invisible.”     The company is also accused of degrading the customer experience by “replacing relevant, organic search results with paid advertisements and junk ads,” which also defrauded sellers expecting a return on advertising purchases.  The FTC and the attorney generals are seeking a permanent injunction that would prohibit Amazon from continuing its illegal conduct in an effort to break up its monopoly of power, thereby evening the playing field among competitors.   Amazon responded to the FTC lawsuit, saying it was misguided and would hurt consumers by leading to higher prices and slower deliveries.  \"The practices the FTC is challenging have helped to spur competition and innovation across the retail industry and have produced greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds for Amazon customers and greater opportunity for the many businesses that sell in Amazon’s store,\" said David Zapolsky, Amazon's general counsel.  A long time coming After years of complaints, c ritics say Amazon’s nationwide network of delivery vans and warehouses should be separated and sold off from Amazon's web business.  Amazon joins a list of other tech giants who have been accused by US lawmakers of abusing their powers to strategically control search engines, social media, and online retailing   –  essentially becoming the gatekeepers of what information is being fed to online consumers and then profiting off the control.   \"Amazon is now exploiting that monopoly power to harm its customers, both the tens of millions of families that shop on Amazon's platform and the hundreds of thousands of sellers that use Amazon to reach them,\" said FTC Chair Lina Khan.   Khan had been chomping on the bit to crack down on the Seattle-based company since her days as a law student writing about the threat of an Amazon monopoly in \"The Yale Law Journal.\"     twitter       \"No corporation has ever centralized this much power across so many crucial sectors,\" said   Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance .   Mitchell and the Institute have also pushed for the US government to take action against Amazon's corrupt practices.   \"Left unchecked, Amazon’s power to dictate and control threatens the rule of law and our ability to maintain open, democratically governed markets,\" Mitchell said.   \"Either way, the shareholders win. If FTC loses its status quo, if the company breaks up, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, as the AWS (cloud) business will command a very high multiple. Analysts will figure this out soon, but for now, it's 'shoot first, ask questions later,'\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at the Boston-based private equity firm Great Hill Capital.  Amazon was founded in 1994 and is now worth more than $1 trillion.    The seventeen states joining the FTC lawsuit include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.   Federal anti-trust lawsuits were also filed against Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms' Facebook earlier this year.

{"title": "MGM says its recovered from cyberattack, employees tell different story", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "MGM Resorts says all its hotels and casinos are now “operating normally” in the wake of last week’s debilitating cyberattack – but some MGM workers say behind the scenes tells quite a different story of massive amounts of lost employee data and an employer keeping them in the dark.   The Las Vegas-based mega hospitality group released several statements Wednesday on its website touting its recovery after a nearly 10-day  ransomware attack  that began last Monday.   The  attack  forced the company to shut down network systems, debilitating hotel and gambling operations at more than a dozen MGM resorts on the Vegas strip and several others located in the US.     In its latest update, also posted on X (formally known as Twitter), MGM states, “We are pleased that all our hotels and casinos are operating normally. Our amazing employees are ready to help guests with any intermittent issues.”     twitter     The company also addressed some issues with MGM rewards members missing points, saying that accounts will be adjusted at a later date.   An earlier statement Wednesday reminded guests that “resort services, dining, entertainment, pools, and spas” were back up and running, as well as gaming floors, table games, and poker rooms.  The MGM rewards app, all MGM brand websites, ATMs, credit card machines, slot machines, check-in systems, and digital guest room keys were completely inoperable for most of last week, expected to cost the company unprecedented financial losses.   That's besides a tarnished reputation on social media as  post after post  showed hours-long lines at the front desks at all MGM hotels and slot machines flashing errors on casino floors.     twitter     \"Our slot machine ticket-in/ticket-out systems are back up and running, and our casino cashiers and slot guest service representatives are happy to help guests who may experience intermittent issues,\"   the MGM statements said.        Guests are also able to make dining and spa reservations through the website and the rewards app, it said.   Not everything is as it seems Although gaming floors are open and ATMs are working, hotel cashiers are still unable to offer cash advance or check cashing on Wednesday. MGM said.  MGM digital room keys and mobile app check-in were also still unavailable, forcing the front desk to continue issuing physical keys to guests.   Last week, guests complained about a room key free for all, with keys unlocking multiple rooms and elevators. This allowed guests to access every floor in the hotel and created a security nightmare.   As rumors of the hotel possibly not being able to make payroll last week surfaced on social media,   MGM employees are also breaking their silence about the chaos happening behind closed doors.  Las Vegas content creator and X user @JacobsVegasLife recently posted, \" The situation for MGM Employees is worse than most of us realize.\"  “It's not just our work schedule,” one alleged MGM employee wrote in a private message the social media influencer posted on X. The worker accused MGM of “caring more about slots and ATMs working.”  “Its anything to do with being an employee at MGM,” they wrote.   “No schedule...no vacation (PTO) hours… All info pertaining to my 401… Time card and tokes made… Attendance points.”   “They hacked into our entire employment info. My social, my husband and kids' socials, all my bank info. We have gotten ZERO answers about anything,” the worker stated.      twitter     MGM, so far, has not provided any information about what information was compromised in the hack or how much sensitive data may have been stolen by the attackers.  Even more proof that the resort is being forced to revamp its entire system in the wake of the attack is this ad placed by MGM for a  \" Red Hat Linux System Admin willing to work 10 hours per day 7 days a week to completely rebuild its IT environment,\" as posted by X user @LasVegasLocally.    twitter      Fellow resort conglomerate  Caesars Entertainment  was also reportedly hit by the same attackers that week. Still, rumors say Casears decided to quietly pay a purported $15M ransom to keep its operations afloat.  Known ransomware gang  Scattered Spider  has laid claim to the attacks, which security insiders say were carried out using targeted but simple social engineering tactics the group is known for successfully using against its targets.    Scattered Spider is a known affiliate of the infamous ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gang. The gang recently posted a   lengthy description of the MGM attack   on its ALPHV’s dark web blog.

{"title": "Pegasus strike on Putin critics prompts warnings from Apple and experts", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "An outlawed Russian journalist in exile has learned her iPhone is infected with Pegasus spyware. Many are left worrying about privacy and security as the same zero-click tool is used both by dictators and democratic countries, and there may be no way around it.  Galina Timchenko is a co-founder, CEO, and publisher of  Meduza,  a prominent Russian independent media outlet based in Latvia. And she found her iPhone had been infected with Israeli firm NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware while on a trip in Germany, a  joint investigation  by Access Now and Citizen Lab revealed.  The fact was brought to light by Apple, as it sent a notification to Timchenko’s device “that state-sponsored attackers may be targeting her iPhone.”     Researchers tested the device and discovered that Pegasus spyware had been lurking since around mid-February. At the time of infection, Timchenko was in Berlin, attending a private gathering with other members of Russian independent media living in exile.  “I already felt like I’d been stripped naked in the town square. Like someone had reached into my pocket. Like I was dirty somehow,”  Timchenko said .  The disturbing news sent shockwaves across social media: cybersecurity researchers doubt that targeted users can avoid such intrusions into their privacy and security.  It is not even clear who is behind this Pegasus attack, as many countries are suspected of using the spyware, including European states Latvia, Estonia, Germany, and also Russia and its allies such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.  The journalist Timchenko was attacked two weeks after the Russian government declared  Meduza  an “undesirable organization” for its critical coverage of Vladimir Putin’s regime and the war in Ukraine. At the same time, European politicians were arguing for increased surveillance on Russians in exile, the investigation found.  Other journalists received alerts Another journalist, Yevgeny Erlich, the former editor-in-chief of TV program  Baltiya  at the Russian independent media outlet Current Time (Настоящее Время), announced on Thursday that he had also received the notification from Apple.  He warned readers that prior communications with him might have been breached, and he is unable to maintain private conversations.     The Apple warning reads: “ALERT: State-sponsored attackers may be targeting your iPhone. Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID ***@gmail.com. These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do.”  Like Timchenko, Erlich also is using a Latvian SIM card. He hopes “intelligence agencies will recover from disappointment,” as he has nothing to hide.  “And yes, my iPhone sometimes acts weird, at least it keeps heating up intermittently in a flat spot. And my messenger suddenly within a day on its own (but on my behalf) started to form some abstract groups of my friends and offer them to collectively chat with me,” he added.  The same  notifications were also received  by the staff of  Novaya Gazeta , an independent Russian newspaper also published in Latvia.  “They threaten the very foundation of free speech” Mantas Sasnauskas, the head of the Cybernews research team, warns that the very essence of privacy is under siege as surveillance tools evolve and become more sophisticated.  “The recent revelations surrounding the Pegasus spyware, particularly its alleged use on Galina Timchenko’s device, shed light on the increasingly complex digital espionage landscape we’re navigating,” he said. “Journalists, who are instrumental in upholding democratic values by scrutinizing those in power, find themselves in an increasingly vulnerable position.”  The implications extend beyond mere breaches of individual privacy. Sasnauskas worries that they threaten the very foundation of free speech and can cast a shadow over the realm of investigative journalism.  “If journalists are constantly anxious about their safety and the protection of their sources, it could stifle in-depth investigative work. As we venture deeper into this digital age, it's crucial for international communities to implement rigorous regulations and oversight on spyware usage, ensuring that the bedrock principles of democracy, such as a free press, remain intact,” he added.  Block ads now, researchers urge    John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, shared worrying findings about Pegasus on X.  “Block ads on your networks now. The system designed to follow us around the net with ads is now a blinking national security and human rights threat. Once, the capability was limited to governments. Now, mercenary spyware companies are selling it in a predictable step,” he writes.    twitter     He compared the vulnerability to a devastating and unfixable backdoor that chases users around the internet, adding that the security vulnerabilities are interwoven with the web’s very digital fabric.  “The incentives are simple: ad companies will do everything they can to make sure you get tracked and shown ads. So do their customers,” Scott-Railton said.  While helpful, adblocker is a “leaky band-aid at best,” and tricky to use on phones, especially when many apps incorporate ads.  “Any network, government to corporate, university to nonprofit, should block all ads and tracking at the gateway,” Scott-Railton urges.  What else do we know about the hack? Sophisticated spyware, Pegasus bypasses encryption and completely controls the victim’s phone, including access to photos, messages, contacts, camera, and microphone, with zero user input required to trigger the attack.  “Pegasus is designed to obfuscate which government is behind a particular attack, making it difficult for us to attribute. However, based on NSO Group’s assertion that Pegasus is only sold to state agencies and the available technical and circumstantial evidence, there are several theories of which state is likely behind the attack,” Access Now and Citizen Lab researchers said.    They provided only speculations without any assurance about where the attack could have arisen.  Latvia, where  Meduza  resides, was mentioned  amongst 45 countries  suspected to be NSO Pegasus users. But Citizen Lab doesn’t believe Latvia would use spyware outside its borders. The police agency of Germany, where Timchenko was staying at the time of her phone’s infection, is also mentioned amongst potential Pegasus customers.  “Two other reported European Pegasus customers, the Netherlands’ General Intelligence and Security Service ( AIVD ) and an unnamed  Estonian  government agency, appear to use Pegasus extensively outside their borders, including within multiple European countries,” said Citizen Lab.  Other possibilities include that states with ties to Russia that are suspected Pegasus users may have hacked  Meduza  on behalf of Moscow. Russia could have also been directly involved, but experts on the Kremlin’s intelligence services, like journalist Andrei Soldatov, are not  convinced that  Russia has been using Pegasus.   Access Now and Citizen Lab call for action to implement an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer, servicing, and use of targeted digital surveillance technologies until human rights safeguards are put in place to regulate such practices, and also want to see a ban on vendors and spyware that facilitates or enables human rights abuses.  The crackdown on Russian media left many journalists in exile, risking persecution domestically. Timchenko founded  Meduza  in 2014 after the owner of Russian news website Lenta.ru removed her as the chief editor for publishing an interview with the head of a Ukrainian nationalist group. Putin’s regime officially outlawed  Meduza  in January 2023.  Apple’s to-do list Apple is known for resisting any efforts to tamper with its devices. The company recently unveiled a new security feature to block government spyware and warned users in 150 countries that their devices may have been hacked. Apple has filed a lawsuit against Israeli cyber firm NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies for allegedly targeting US Apple users with  its Pegasus spyware .  Apple threat notifications  are designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers. The support page explains that such threat actors are well-funded and sophisticated, and their attacks evolve over time.  “Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete,” said Apple. “It’s possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected. We are unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future.”  All users should continue to protect themselves from cybercriminals and consumer malware by following best practices for security:     Update devices to the latest software, as that includes the latest security fixes  Protect devices with a passcode  Use two-factor authentication and a strong password for Apple ID  Install apps from the App Store  Use strong and unique passwords online  Don’t click on links or attachments from unknown senders   Pegasus: a shady history Now notorious, Pegasus spyware has been found to be involved in many political incidents, as oppressive regimes often use such  tools for nefarious purposes .  The European Union has recently found evidence that smartphones used by some of its staff were compromised. At least  14 EU countries, including Hungary and Poland , have been accused of using Israeli firm NSO Group’s notorious spyware for various purposes that include stifling dissent and silencing journalists.   Pegasus spyware’s ugly head  has also reared  in the context of a protracted border dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  In the US, the government declared the spyware to be a threat to national security, banned its use, and blacklisted NSO Group in 2021.  Nonprofit organization Access Now is known for its mission to defend and extend digital civil rights.

{"title": "Google patches Chrome zero-day exploited in wild", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Google has released an update to fix a critical bug in its browser, Chrome. The tech giant says the flaw has been exploited in the wild.  “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2023-4863 exists in the wild,” the company said in an advisory, but refrained from detailing the precise nature of it.  Users in the stable and extended stable channels will be the first to receive the update. Google said other users will receive the patch in the coming days and weeks.    Google described the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-4863, as a heap buffer overflow in WebP. In other words, too much data was going to a temporary storage area, potentially allowing a threat actor to leverage the flaw for arbitrary code execution – essentially, to mount a cyberattack.  The bug impacting Chrome was reported by Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) and Citizen Lab at the University of Torontoʼs Munk School on September 9th, Google  said .  “We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel,” reads the tech giant’s advisory.  The latest Chrome zero-day is the fourth of its kind Google has had to fix this year after the tech giant patched CVE-2023-2033, CVE-2023-2136, and CVE-2023-3079.  Last week, Citizen Lab discovered a zero-click vulnerability  affecting Apple devices . “Zero-click” means the target doesn’t have to tap or click anything to trigger the attack. According to the researchers, the vulnerability was used to deliver NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.  The Pegasus Project  revealed  that the spyware, made and licensed by NSO Group, had been used in attempted and successful hacks of smartphones belonging to journalists, government officials, and human rights activists.

{"title": "Twitter whistleblower and noted hacker scooped up by Biden admin", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "One of America’s first recognized “white hat” hackers and more recent Twitter whistleblower, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, has accepted the role of senior technical advisor for the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).  CISA director Jen Easterly retweeted the story first reported by The Washington Post Tuesday.   “SUPER PUMPED to welcome O.G. Hacker @dotMudge to Team @CISAgov to help advance #SecureByDesign!,” Easterly posted on X (formerly known as Twitter).      twitter     The former head of security at  Twitter  (now X) was called to testify last September by the US Senate Judiciary Committee over his 84-page whistleblower complaint against the company over its lax data security.   In the  complaint , Zatko accused Twitter’s then-leadership of deliberately misleading the public about the platform’s “security, privacy, and integrity.”   Zatko also had charged the social messaging platform with fraudulently misleading stakeholders and turning a blind eye “to efforts by foreign governments to infiltrate, control, exploit, surveil, and censor the company’s staff, platform, and operations.”  The cybersecurity expert, who has also worked for Google, was fired by Musk in January.   Zatko – who goes by the nickname “Mudge” – is also known as one of the most renowned members of America’s first hacker think tank to testify on Capitol Hill about the vulnerable state of the US government’s computer systems back in 1988.   The internationally covered testimony of the Boston-based l0pht collective is considered the first known instance of responsible disclosure and the first time the US government publicly acknowledged “hackers” in a positive context.   “Mudge joins us in a part-time capacity to help us collaboratively shape a culture of security by design that is foundational to every security team, every C-suite, and every board room in the country,” Easterly said in a written statement, reported the Post.    The famed Mudge   –   additionally known as part of the 80s alternative hacktivist group  the Cult of the Dead Cow   –  will step into his newly obtained expert role starting this week on a part-time basis.   The US government’s  Secure by Design  initiative puts the onus on manufacturers to build software security into all steps of their design processes by default – preceding development, configuration, and shipment of products, according to CISA.  Coinciding with Zatko’s appointment, CISA also announced a new Secure by Design program involving the  K-12  education sector.     twitter     The program aims to collect commitment pledges from American educational software technology providers to design products with greater built-in security.   “We need to address K-12 cybersecurity issues at its foundation by ensuring schools and administrators have access to technology and software that is safe and secure right out of the box,” said Easterly.  So far six manufacturers have already signed the voluntary pledge Classlink, Clever, D2L, GG4L, Instructure, and PowerSchool.

Forever 21 encountered what it termed a cyber incident that impacted a “limited number” of its systems on March 20, 2023. The investigation  unveiled  that an unauthorized third party accessed files from specific systems between January 5, 2023, and March 21, 2023.  “We have no evidence to suggest your information has been misused for purposes of fraud or identity theft as a result of this incident – and no reason to believe that it will be. Forever 21 has taken steps to help assure that the unauthorized third party no longer has access to the data,” the company said.  It also believes that the third party hasn’t copied, retained, or shared any of the data, and therefore, the risk to individuals is low. According to the data breach notice with the Maine Attorney General’s Office, the incident might have impacted 539,207 people. The compromised data included:   Name    Social Security number    Date of birth    Bank account number (without access codes or PINs)    Information regarding health plans     Forever 21 has hundreds of locations and approximately 50,000 employees.

{"title": "Meta starts roll-out of E2EE for all Messenger users", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "In a move certain to draw more ire from unfriendly governments, Meta said it started enabling end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default for all Messenger users.  Not a lot can unite tech companies and human rights activists – but efforts to implement E2EE on user chats certainly can.  That’s because concerns over moves in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to make it easier for law enforcement to access encrypted messages to help tackle child abuse continue to grow.    Meta said that it expected to finish the procedures and have all Messenger users on E2EE chats by the end of the year. The company has been working on the project since 2019 and  explained in a blog post  it had to rebuild more than 100 features to accommodate encrypted chats.  “The goal is to enhance the security we already provide and give people additional confidence that their personal messages will remain private,” said Timothy Byck, product manager at Messenger.  However, the UK has long been pushing tech companies to actually open up E2EE communications in the name of child safety with its  Online Safety Bill .  Callum Voge, a senior government affairs and advocacy advisor at the Internet Society, a global nonprofit organization fighting for open and secure internet, also told Cybernews in an interview recently the European Commission’s  proposal  for addressing the proliferation of online child sexual abuse material online would actually make everyone, including children, less safe.  According  to Voge and lots of other online privacy advocates, the proposal, if implemented, will threaten encryption in the form of automated searches for child sexual abuse material.  Now, in Australia, seemingly eager to follow the UK’s lead, the Criminal Intelligence Commission also said that plans by Meta to make Messenger and Instagram E2EE messaging raised concerns that existing technologies the platforms use to detect child abuse material will not work.   “The National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children has estimated that Meta’s implementation of end-to-end encryption across all its major platforms will reduce the number of child sexual abuse material reports it receives by more than 50%,” the Commission said.  Debates aren’t exactly raging yet as the draft legislation in both the EU and the UK remain under discussion. And even if the proposals are adopted, they’re certain to face legal challenges.

{"title": "Just like China: UK wants to stop companies from patching vulnerabilities", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "The government of the United Kingdom is planning to require companies and researchers to report newly-found security vulnerabilities and leave them unpatched. This is what China is already doing.  The recently  unveiled plans  to revise the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA), the primary legislation governing the surveillance of electronic communications in the UK, have caught the eyes of cybersecurity and internet freedom experts.  That’s because the proposed revisions of the IPA – even if they’re cloaked in typical  Bureaucratese  – smell of huge consequences to cybersecurity professionals.     “Companies must work with us” The UK government is already allowed by law to demand that companies alter their services in a manner that may affect all users. For instance, end-to-end encryption by WhatsApp or Signal can be removed or undermined worldwide if London decides that such a measure is proportionate to the aim sought.  However, the proposed changes could add another layer to the regulatory landscape – an obligation for companies to notify the government before introducing any technical changes to their systems.  This means that any messaging service planning to introduce an important and much-needed security feature would now have to first let the Home Office know in advance. Device manufacturers, regularly fixing vulnerabilities, would also have to inform the government.    \"You can't be globally competitive when you need a UK bureaucrat to OK emergency updates fixing an actively exploited flaw,\"   John Scott-Railton   “Accordingly, the Secretary of State, upon receiving such an advance notice, could now request operators to, for instance, abstain from patching security gaps to allow the government to maintain access for surveillance purposes,”  says  Ioannis Kouvakas, a senior legal office and assistant general counsel for Privacy International.   The UK government insists that “companies and governments can, and do, work together to ensure the safety of the public on a range of threats, from child sexual exploitation and abuse to terrorism content.”  “But, in order for that cooperation to be effective, and for our investigatory powers to remain effective against a backdrop of rapid technological change, companies must work openly and willingly with us,” the text of the consultation highlights.    Breach of international law? Kouvakas thinks that the UK would breach international human rights law if it implemented the revisions and thus interfered with the privacy and security of online users.  According to him, these measures, undermining end-to-end encryption and other security tools designed to protect the user, are unlikely to survive the necessity and proportionality test enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto,  said on Twitter/X  that London’s move is “catastrophically shortsighted.”  “Any tech product that stays will be suspect in the global marketplace. The sector will flee. Goodbye tech investment & jobs. You can't be globally competitive when you need a UK bureaucrat to OK emergency updates fixing an actively exploited flaw,” said Scott-Railton.  “And you can't be trusted when the UK government can secretly stop you from securing your users.”  China has already been engaging in such practices . Every vulnerability discovered by Chinese researchers – who used to dominate marquee hacking competitions just a few years ago – has to be immediately reported to the government.

{"title": "Snapchat's AI posts an obscure story and admits it got a bit carried away", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Snapchat users freaked out on Tuesday when Snapchat's AI chatbot went rogue, posted a video in a story, and stopped responding to users’ messages.  On Tuesday, many Snapchat users freaked out as the AI chatbot posted a story on its own. This functionality was still unavailable for a chatbot. “My snap ai just posted a story. I’m extremely frightened,” wrote a Snapchat user on X.    twitter       The story was a one-second video, showing something looking like a room setting and a fragment of ceilings. The video made the users question whether their privacy was violated and whether they were filmed, as some of them recognized the colors of their walls in the video.    twitter     After posting the story, the chatbot stopped responding to the messages. One user shared a chat recording with AI, where it was not willing to talk about the posted story and kept saying it was busy to chat now.  Finally, the user managed to get some responses about the posted story. AI said it remembered the posted story and asked what the user thought of it. “Sometimes I like to get a little bit creative,” wrote the chatbot. “I guess I got a little carried away. Won’t happen again, I promise.”    twitter     Snapchat representatives told CNN on Wednesday that the chatbot’s behavior was a glitch, and now it is fixed.  Snapchat introduced  AI chatbot  called “My AI” in May this year. The social app integrated ChatGPT to power its chatbot. In a review published in June, Snapchat reported that over 150 million users had already sent 10 billion messages to My AI, making it “among the largest consumer chatbots available today.”   The company claims that it has trained the AI to follow trust and safety guidelines and not give responses that include cursing, violence, sexually explicit content, or personal viewpoints on sensitive subjects like politics.

{"title": "The New York Times bans use of its content to train AI", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "The paper of record has changed its terms of service to forbid its content from being used to train artificial intelligence models without its prior consent.   The updated rules say that content produced by  The New York Times  cannot be used in the development of “any software program, including, but not limited to, training a machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) system.”   The document says the ban covers, but is not limited to text, photographs, images, illustrations, designs, audio clips, video clips, “look and feel,” metadata, data, or compilations.    Updated on August 3rd, the terms of service also ban the use of automated tools like website crawlers to collect and use such content without the publication’s prior written consent.   The New York Times  warns that engaging in the prohibited use of the services could result in penalties, fines, or sanctions against the user or those assisting the user, but does not specify further.   According to  Adweek , which first reported the news,  The New York Times  is taking a novel approach in explicitly mentioning  AI training  in its terms or service.   While publishers can see web crawlers visiting their websites, they have no way of knowing whether they are used for search engine optimization or for training AI models, it said.   Updating service terms could give newsrooms more control over how their content is used.   To address some of these concerns, OpenAI has recently announced that publishers will be able to block its GPTBot web crawler aimed at improving AI models from scraping their websites.   Neither Microsoft nor Google, other significant players in the field, have taken similar steps.

{"title": "China will require all apps to share business details in new oversight push", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "China will require all mobile app providers in the country to file business details with the government, its information ministry said, marking Beijing's latest effort to keep the industry on a tight leash.  The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said late on Tuesday that apps without proper filings will be punished after the grace period that will end in March next year, a move that experts say would potentially restrict the number of apps and hit small developers hard.  You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Office, said the order is effectively requiring approvals from the ministry. The new rule is primarily aimed at combating online fraud but it will impact all apps in China, he said.    Rich Bishop, co-founder of app publishing firm AppInChina, said the new rule is also likely to affect foreign-based developers which have been able to publish their apps easily through Apple's App Store without showing any documentation to the Chinese government.  Bishop said that in order to comply with the new rules, app developers now must either have a company in China or work with a local publisher.  Apple, the iPhone maker pulled over a hundred artificial intelligence (AI) apps from its App Store last week to comply with regulations after China introduced a new licensing regime for generative AI apps for the country.  The ministry's notice also said entities \"engaged in internet information services through apps in such fields as news, publishing, education, film and television and religion should also submit relevant documents.\"  The requirement could affect the availability of popular social media apps such as X, Facebook and Instagram. Use of such apps are not allowed in China, but they can still be downloaded from app stores, enabling Chinese to use them when traveling overseas.  China already requires mobile games to obtain licenses before they launch in the country and it had purged tens of thousands of unlicensed games from various app stores in 2020.

{"title": "Expert voices pile up on Microsoft’s “negligent” security management", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Software giant Microsoft takes far too long to patch discovered security flaws and leaves customers unprotected and uninformed. The latest public criticism comes from Amit Yoran, CEO of security company Tenable.  Microsoft, recently under pressure after  Chinese hackers entered  US government email accounts, has received renewed criticism.  CEO Yoran added fuel to the fire, claiming that his company discovered  a serious issue  with the Azure platform in March 2023 and it took more than 90 days for Microsoft to implement a fix. Even then, the fix was partial. The discovered vulnerability would enable an unauthenticated attacker to access cross-tenant applications and sensitive data such as authentication secrets.    “To give you an idea of how bad this is, our team very quickly discovered authentication secrets to a bank,”  Yoran writes in a LinkedIn post .  He slams Microsoft’s lack of transparency applied to breaches, irresponsible security practices, and vulnerabilities, exposing their customers to risks “they are deliberately kept in the dark about.”   “The truth is even worse than you think,” he claims, as the bank he referred to is still vulnerable today, more than 120 days since the concerned team first reported the issue. That leaves customers uninformed and unable to make informed decisions for risk mitigation.  “Microsoft claims that they will fix the issue by the end of September, four months after we notified them. That’s grossly irresponsible, if not blatantly negligent. We know about the issue, Microsoft knows about the issue, and hopefully, threat actors don’t,” Yoran writes, quoting data from Google Project Zero on Microsoft products accounting for an aggregate of 42.5% of all zero-days discovered since 2014.  This post led to cascade of reactions supporting the claims.  George Kurtz, CEO & Founder of the security technology company CrowdStrike “couldn’t agree more” that Microsoft puts customers at risk and puts the blame on the victim when the problem with “broken architecture” arises.  “There is way more to this story than we are hearing,” Kurtz added.    twitter       At the same time, a few security firms disclosed reports about new attack vectors that could be leveraged against Azure.  Vectra Research identified a new attack vector against Azure Active Directory that enables  lateral movement to other Microsoft tenants .  And Sygnia revealed new attack vectors in the Azure AD Connect, focusing on the Password Hash Sync mechanism. These vectors allow attackers to intercept connector credentials via man-in-the-middle attacks or inject malicious code.  A week before, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received a letter from  Senator Ron Wyden  asking them to hold Microsoft accountable for a repeated pattern of negligent cybersecurity practices, which enabled Chinese espionage against the United States government.  The Senator demanded Microsoft’s responsibility for the compromise of hundreds of thousands of governmental emails and email accounts, including from the Secretary of Commerce, the US Ambassador to China, and the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia.  In a letter, he noticed that similar attacks happened before – for example, the  2020 SolarWinds hacking campaign  used a similar technique. However, Microsoft never took responsibility for its role and “blamed federal agencies for not pushing it to prioritize defending against the encryption key theft technique used by Russia, which Microsoft had known about since 2017.”  Microsoft officials  commented to Ars Technica  that the company follows an extensive process involving a thorough investigation.   “Developing a security update is a delicate balance between timeliness and quality, while ensuring maximized customer protection with minimized customer disruption,” it said.

{"title": "Kazakhstan says it will use AI to prevent bullying in army", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Kazakhstan plans to use artificial intelligence to monitor its troops for “non-statutory” behavior in a military modernization push.   The Central Asian nation’s Ministry of Defense said it was working on a unified platform that would leverage its network of surveillance cameras and facial recognition technology to monitor and prevent bullying, hazing, and other violations in its armed forces.  “We have more than 50,000 different types of video cameras in our military units,” Deputy Defense Minister Darkhan Akhmediyev said, according to a report by  Vlast , a local news website.    “Unfortunately, they do not have a unified platform, a system that would use artificial intelligence tools to prevent non-statutory relations or some violations,” he said.   This is about to change with a single video analytics system that will pilot later this year and is expected to be fully operational in 2024, according to the report.   \"For example, if a person falls, artificial intelligence gives a signal that attention needs to be paid here. And such macro data is sent to the higher level, that is, to the high command or to the national defense control center,\" Akhmediyev said.   Additionally, the new platform will be used to monitor crowds, analyze personnel’s presence, and keep track of the number of vehicles entering and leaving the facilities.  The move comes as part of Kazakhstan’s efforts to modernize its military forces following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.   In addition to boosting its defense spending and training, Kazakhstan reviewed its armed forces doctrine last year to reflect “current military security threats.”   In a March meeting with military leadership, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev stressed the “need for improvement of the military command system using modern digital approaches.”   The Defense Ministry was ordered to revise its combat training program and work on boosting troops’ professional level to elevate the prestige of military service and motivate young people to join its ranks.

{"title": "With Hollywood still on strike, Netflix posts $900,000 AI job", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "87% of Hollywood actors earn less than $26,000 a year – unsurprisingly, they’re still striking. But Netflix executives would rather spend – lavishly – on artificial intelligence programs.  Hollywood actors – and writers – continue to strike and call for higher pay and better working conditions. In addition to more traditional demands, the strikers want large studios and streaming services to restrict or at least carefully regulate the use of AI.  The Writers Guild of America (WGA), for example, seeks a commitment from studios not to use AI as source material, and not to use the material created by its members to train large language models.    The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) are worried over alleged plans to replace them with digital replicas created, once again, with the help of AI technology.  But Netflix, the biggest streaming platform in the world, is seemingly moving forward with huge investments in AI and embracing the technology with open arms. As revealed by The Intercept, in one case, Netflix is offering up to $900,000 for a single AI product manager.  Now, the  job description  itself doesn’t say that actors or writers are to be replaced by Netflix’s AI systems. The company explains that its Machine Learning Platform needs a roadmap and a strategic plan, so a manager is needed.  But the research section on Netflix’s website describes the aforementioned platform as a tool used for content creation – not only recommendations.  “Historically, personalization has been the most well-known area where machine learning powers our recommendation algorithms. We’re also using machine learning to help shape our catalog of movies and TV shows by learning characteristics that make content successful,”  Netflix says .  “We use it to optimize the production of original movies and TV shows in Netflix’s rapidly growing studio.”  Actors aren’t happy. Rob Delaney, the star of the TV show  Catastrophe  who’s known for his political activism,  told  The Intercept: “So $900k/yr per soldier in their godless AI army when that amount of earnings could qualify thirty-five actors and their families for SAG-AFTRA health insurance is just ghoulish.”        “Having been poor and rich in this business, I can assure you there’s enough money to go around. It’s just about priorities,” added Delaney.  Disney, for one, is also seemingly keen to have options. The corporation, just like Netflix, has listed job openings for AI-related positions and is, for instance, looking for a senior AI engineer to “drive innovation” across the firm’s properties.  The entertainment industry, in other words, is keen to make massive investments in AI, especially generative AI. If AI models can be trained to replace humans like actors or writers, their wages will be much smaller indeed.

{"title": "OpenAI to invest $5 million in local news", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, will commit $5 million to support local news in a partnership with the American Journalism Project (AJP).  The new partnership is meant to future-proof local journalism through “smart” experimentation with AI, according to the AJP.   The organization said it would work with OpenAI and local news organizations to develop and deploy AI tools that could help bolster local reporting.    It is one way to ensure local journalism “remains an essential pillar of our democracy,” AJP CEO Sarabeth Berman said in an announcement of the partnership.  “In these early days of generative AI, we have the opportunity to ensure that local news organizations, and their communities, are involved in shaping its implications,” she added.  OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said his company supports the AJP’s mission to “strengthen our democracy by rebuilding the country’s local news sector.”   “This collaboration underscores our mission and belief that AI should benefit everyone and be used as a tool to enhance work,” he said.   The AJP will distribute direct grants to 10 out of 41 organizations in its portfolio, which will experiment with the best ways to leverage AI responsibly in their newsrooms and business operations.   While AI presents challenges to  news media , including the potential for misinformation and issues related to bias, privacy, and copyright, it can also enable deeper data analysis, enhance user experience, and foster new formats for information delivery, the AJP said.  The AJP will also use the funds to establish an AI studio that will share expertise with the news organizations involved in the project and serve as a hub for communication with OpenAI and other external partners to create a “feedback loop.”   In addition to $5 million in grants, OpenAI will provide the AJP and its portfolio organizations with $5 million worth of credits to access its products.     Just last week, OpenAI announced that it signed a deal with The Associated Press (AP) to license the news agency’s archive of news stories.   Meanwhile, AP will leverage OpenAI’s technology and product expertise, the two organizations said in a joint statement. The financial details of the deal are unclear, AP reported.

{"title": "Google says AI chatbot Bard is coming to Europe, finally", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Google’s ChatGPT rival Bard will soon be accessible in Europe and Brazil, as a new expansion was announced.   On July 13th, Google stated that its AI chatbot Bard is expanding to include users in Europe and Brazil. It’s the product's biggest expansion since its February launch, and will be accompanied by the release of a handful of new features.  According to the company, Bard will support more than 40 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, German, Hindi, and Spanish. The new features will also allow more personalized responses, granting users the ability to listen to the responses and choose the AI's tone, whether it be simple, long, short, professional, or casual.    The chatbot will also allow the use of images in the prompts. This feature is currently only supported in the English language. Starting Thursday, the company is also expanding Bard’s application for coding tasks. Users will be able to export Bard-generated Python code to Replit, in addition to Google Colab.   Coming late to Europe In May, the company announced that the Bard  chatbot  was already accessible in over 180 countries and territories across the world, however, the list excluded European countries. Bard's launch in Europe was likely delayed due to insufficient details about data privacy and the European regulatory environment.  There has been a massive push to regulate AI in Europe. In spring, the EU introduced the AI Act to regulate the usage and expansion of AI technologies, ensuring that AI systems used in the EU are “safe, transparent, traceable, non-discriminatory and environmentally friendly.”   “As part of our bold and responsible approach to AI, we’ve proactively engaged with experts, policymakers, and privacy regulators on this expansion. And as we bring Bard to more regions and languages over time, we’ll continue to use our AI Principles as a guide, incorporate user feedback, and take steps to protect people’s privacy and data,” wrote the company on Thursday.  Rough start While tech companies are racing to secure their share in the booming AI market, the main rival to Microsoft-backed ChatGPT has had a rough start. Google’s shares plummeted 9% when Bard gave  inaccurate answers  in a promotional video, that was presented as a demonstration of its abilities during a live press conference.   Reportedly,  Google employees  were instructed to get involved in identifying and fixing any wrong queries produced by the chatbot.     On the same day that news about the Bard updates dropped, Bloomberg reported that Google staff training the AI chatbot claim to be underpaid and overworked. This has raised concerns regarding the quality of the product.  Documents shared with the outlet showed that workers without specific expertise are expected to assess answers in subjects ranging from medication doses to state laws. Furthermore, they’re allegedly being instructed to meet strict deadlines for auditing answers, which can be as short as three minutes.

{"title": "SolarView flaw exposes hundreds of solar farms", "published_date": "07 July 2023 ", "description": "Security experts warn that a critical vulnerability is putting hundreds of solar power stations worldwide at risk.   Hundreds of solar power stations are exposed to “actively exploited” vulnerability allowing threat actors to launch attacks and gain access to their systems remotely, according to VulnCheck, a security firm.   According to SolarView manufacturer, the Japan-based company Contec, approximately 30,000 power stations use its devices to monitor power generation, storage, and distribution operations.     The system is “clearly intended” for closed networks, VulnCheck said. However, it found 600 SolarView devices that can be reached via the internet, with over two-thirds of them yet to install the patch that mitigates the flaw labeled as CVE-2022-29303.  The flaw arises from the system’s inability to neutralize potentially harmful elements in user-supplied input, exposing it to remote attacks. Citing earlier research by Palo Alto Networks,  VulnCheck  noted that Mirai, an open-source botnet, exploits the vulnerability.   “The fact that a number of these systems are internet-facing and that the public exploits have been available long enough to get rolled into a Mirai-variant is not a good situation,” VulnCheck said.  Security experts said the exploitation of SolarView monitoring systems is not significant when considered in isolation, with the loss of view “likely the worst-case scenario.”   “However, the impact of exploitation could be high depending on the network the SolarView hardware is integrated into,” VulnCheck said.   “For instance, if the hardware is part of a solar power generation site, then the attacker may affect the loss of productivity and revenue by using the hardware as a network pivot to attack other ICS resources,” it warned.

{"title": "Nigerian pleads guilty to online business scam", "published_date": "30 June 2023 ", "description": "A Nigerian national extradited from the UK to the US has pleaded guilty to attempting to defraud thousands of businesses around the world out of millions using an online scamming technique known as business email compromise (BEC).  Chibundu Anuebunwa, 40, of Lagos, Nigeria, admitted his role in the scam at a federal court in the Southern District of New York and now faces up to 20 years in a US prison.    Between 2014 and 2016, Aneubunwa and two accomplices sent fraudulent emails to targeted companies in which they pretended to be supervisors or third-party contractors. The aim was to persuade genuine employees to transfer funds to bank accounts controlled by Anuebunwa, David Abindu, and Onyekachi Opara.  The two latter men, also from Nigeria, have already been sentenced to 41 and 60 months in prison respectively.  Commenting on the case, US Attorney Damian Williams said: “As he has now admitted, Chibundu Joseph Anuebunwa participated in a conspiracy to trick thousands of business employees located all around the world into wiring millions of dollars to overseas bank accounts by sending bogus emails that appeared to be legitimate.”  Williams added: “This case should serve as a reminder to cybercriminals located around the globe that we will track them down and hold them responsible.”  To disguise their criminal activity the three men used domain names that appeared very similar to those of legitimate companies, or modified metadata in the BEC emails to make it look as though they had been sent from a bona fide source.  However, it is not clear how much money they actually got away with: announcing Anuebunwa’s guilty plea, the US Department of Justice said that he and his accomplices attempted to steal millions but did not specify how successful they were.  Anuebunwa was extradited from the UK, where he was residing, in May last year and is due to be sentenced in the US on October 2nd.

{"title": "Australia calls Twitter top platform for online hate", "published_date": "23 June 2023 ", "description": "One in three complaints about online hate in Australia are related to Twitter, even though it has far fewer users than other social media sites, the country’s internet safety watchdog said.  It’s official: more than half a year after Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” took control of Twitter, it has become the platform Australians complain about most. The site now faces regulatory scrutiny.  The eSafety Commissioner in Australia announced it had sent Twitter a legal notice, demanding answers about how the platform is tackling online hate.     The site has been given 28 days to clean up “toxicity and hate,” and it will be fined if it fails to comply. The maximum financial penalties of nearly $700,000 Australian dollars a day could be applied.  According to eSafety, it has received more complaints about online hate on Twitter in the past 12 months than any other platform.  Commissioner Julie Inman Grant admitted that Twitter’s  terms of use  and policies currently prohibit hateful conduct on the platform.   But the sheer number of complaints and reports of this content remaining publicly visible on the platform shows that Twitter is not likely to be enforcing its own rules, said Inman Grant.  “Twitter appears to have dropped the ball on tackling hate. A third of all complaints about online hate reported to us are now happening on Twitter,”  said  Inman Grant, who worked on cyber safety at the company after 17 years at Microsoft.  “We are also aware of reports that the reinstatement of some of these previously banned accounts has emboldened extreme polarizers, peddlers of outrage and hate, including neo-Nazis both in Australia and overseas.”  Musk indeed announced a “general amnesty”  in November 2022. Around 62,000 previously banned or suspended users were reinstated to the platform, and many Twitter-watchers soon noticed that most extremist accounts were again engaging in hateful online behavior.          After buying Twitter, Musk initiated the departure of around 80% of the company’s workforce, and, even though a surge in misinformation and hate speech was noticed, soon  disbanded the volunteer Trust and Safety Council . Many employees in Twitter’s trust and safety teams also left or were laid off.     However, in the face of increasing regulatory pressure in the US, the European Union and elsewhere, Musk might be changing tack. He has hired a new chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, who  said  last week that she wanted to turn Twitter into a reliable news source.  And even though  Twitter left the EU’s voluntary pact  against disinformation in late May, Musk said that Twitter will comply with the bloc’s new Digital Services Act (DSA) which will force tech companies to crack down on hate speech, disinformation, and other harmful material on their sites.  “If laws are passed, Twitter will obey the law,” Musk told the France 2 TV channel this week when asked about the DSA. Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner who oversees digital policy, is currently visiting Twitter HQ to check whether Twitter is ready to comply with the strict new standards.

{"title": "Europe wants Google to break up ad business, tech giant upset", "published_date": "16 June 2023 ", "description": "They simply can’t stop. EU regulators hit Google with fresh antitrust charges and say it has to break up its main cash cow – the lucrative digital ad business. Google disagrees.  It’s only a “preliminary view,” but the European Commission has now informed Google that it has judged the company in breach of EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in the advertising technology industry (adtech).  The Commission said in  a press release  that Google favors its own adtech services to the detriment of competing providers, advertisers, and online publishers. This kind of abuse of its dominant position has been in place since at least 2014, regulators said.    Inherent conflicts of interest The only way to satisfy competition concerns, in the view of the regulators, is to sell off parts of the business. According to the Commission, “only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services” would be satisfactory. A “behavioral remedy” is not likely to be effective.  “Google is active on both sides of the market with its publisher ad server and with its ad buying tools and holds a dominant position on both ends. Furthermore, it operates the largest ad exchange. This leads to a situation of inherent conflicts of interest for Google,” said the Commission.  “The Commission's preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns.”  Margrethe Vestager, the Commission’s executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, added that Google was actually present at almost all levels of the adtech supply chain because it collects user data, sells ad space, and acts as an online advertising intermediary.  “Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favor its own intermediation services. Not only did this possibly harm Google’s competitors but also publishers’ interests, while also increasing advertisers’ costs. If confirmed, Google’s practices would be illegal under our competition rules,” said Vestager.    Margrethe Vestager   The announcement is, of course, not unprecedented. The US Justice Department and eight American states filed an  antitrust suit against Google  in January 2023 – also in order to shatter its alleged monopoly on the adtech ecosystem.    In the complaint, the US government also demands that Google divest itself of the adtech-related businesses, remaining with search – its core business – and other products of services such as YouTube, Gmail, and cloud services.  Fines aren’t effective However, it’s the EU that’s paving the way for governments around the world to crack down on Big Tech. For instance, the  European Parliament overwhelmingly voted  to approve the EU’s AI Act, which could set unprecedented restrictions on how companies use artificial intelligence.  Even though the details of the bill are still to be discussed in the European Council, the move nevertheless solidifies Europe’s position as the de facto global tech regulator, The Washington Post said. The new amendments, if adopted, could influence tech policymaking around the world.    \"Breaking our ad tech tools would diminish the availability of free, ad-supported content that benefits everyone,\"   Dan Taylor, Google’s vice-president of global ads.   Google is naturally unhappy – its primary source of revenue is online advertising, afterall. Since the Commission hasn’t yet issued its final decision, the firm will be hoping that it softens its stance.  The company  officially responded to the European regulators , saying that the success of its ad business has helped it keep many of its services free of charge, and that the EU’s investigation has focused on a narrow part of its ad business anyway.  Dan Taylor, Google’s vice-president of global ads, said the Commission’s statement failed to recognize how advertising technology “helps merchants reach customers and grow their businesses – while lowering costs and expanding choices for consumers.”  “The digital advertising market enjoys competitive pricing, lively innovation, and robust competition — helping advertisers, publishers, and consumers. We look forward to showing how our ad tech tools help make the internet open and accessible — and how breaking them would diminish the availability of free, ad-supported content that benefits everyone,” said Taylor.  The EU has previously hit Google with more than 8 billion euros (now $8.6 billion) worth of fines in three separate antitrust cases, involving its Android mobile operating system and shopping and search advertising services. Google has appealed in all three cases.    However, it now seems Brussels has had enough and decided that fines – which can reach up to 10% of annual revenue – aren’t enough.

{"title": "Will natural selection favor AI over humans?", "published_date": "09 June 2023 ", "description": "A coalition of artificial intelligence experts recently released a brief statement warning of the risk of extinction from AI, and one of the signatories, Professor Dan Hendrycks, has employed a Darwinian argument in his new paper.  Hendrycks, the executive director of the Center for AI Safety, states that if AI agents have intelligence that exceeds that of humans, “this could lead to humanity losing control of its future.”  In other words, just like humans are the most successful species on Earth thanks to their high intelligence, AI agents might surpass them if their systems keep evolving and, for instance, start pursuing their own interests with little regard for humans.    This is a sort of futuristic Darwinian logic,  Hendrycks admits  – today’s viral chatbots largely reproduce patterns based on training data they have been fed. They certainly do not think for themselves.   But Hendrycks adds that the mere possibility could pose catastrophic risks. That’s why interventions aimed at counteracting AI-related dangers need to be considered, and rather urgently.  Doomsplaining: is it justified? Hendrycks, now doing rounds in the media, is concerned that AI could pose a greater threat to humanity than something like a pandemic. What if, for example, AI realizes that humans can deactivate it and decides to prevent that by harming us preemptively instead?  “If current trends continue, we should expect AI agents to become just as capable as humans at a growing range of economically relevant tasks. This change could have huge upsides AI could help solve many of the problems humanity faces,” Hendrycks says.  “But, as AIs become increasingly capable of operating without direct human oversight, they could one day be pulling high-level strategic levers. If this happens, the direction of our future will be highly dependent on the nature of these AI agents.”  On the one hand, we can hope for benevolent AI agents that avoid harming humans and apply their skills to the benefit of society. But such an outcome is not guaranteed because AIs will almost certainly become more autonomous.  It seems likely to the scientist that the most influential AI agents in the future will be selfish: “Firstly, natural selection may be a dominant force in AI development. Secondly, evolution by natural selection tends to give rise to selfish behavior.”    So, even if some developers build altruistic AIs, others will build less altruistic ones, and the latter will outcompete the former, according to these Darwinian forces.    “Firstly, natural selection may be a dominant force in AI development. Secondly, evolution by natural selection tends to give rise to selfish behavior.”   Dan Hendrycks.   Doomsplaining? Maybe. But Hendrycks writes that preparing for disastrous worst-case scenarios, up until now only depicted in sci-fi novels or TV shows, “is not overly pessimistic; rather it is prudent.”  Calls for regulation The professor is one of dozens of AI experts and industry leaders who have called for reducing “the risk of global annihilation” due to AI.   “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” reads  the statement  published by the Center for AI Safety.  The statement was signed by leading industry officials, including OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, the so-called “godfather” of AI Geoffrey Hinton, and Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer, among others.  AI-based tools like  OpenAI’s ChatGPT  have been booming in recent months – this specific chatbot is used by hundreds of millions of people each day. In response, lawmakers and activists across the globe have been busy calling for regulation of the industry before any major mishap occurs.  For instance, the European Parliament is currently in the process of drafting its first set of rules to govern the technology in an effort to tame the rapid growth of AI in accordance with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.

The Iraqi government is known for turning off fixed-line and mobile broadband services as a measure to combat cheating during state exams.  As the scheduled final exams commenced on June 1st, Iraq experienced a widespread internet disruption across the country.  Turning off the internet seems to be the Iraqi government’s go-to solution to thwart students from smuggling mobile phones into state tests and curb cheating in exams. Disruptions of similar types were also registered during previous years.      twitter     Similar situation in Syria Iraq is not the only country to experience internet outages. Global network monitoring company NetBlocks registered wide scale disruptions to internet connectivity in Syria, starting on 24th May.   Network outages were noticed from 4 a.m., lasting approximately four hours daily. The outages could be linked with the commencement of national practical and lab exams.    twitter     Creates negative impact Reportedly, some countries’ governments worldwide enforce internet shutdowns during educational examinations, using the rationale of curbing malpractices.

{"title": "Capita probed by UK regulator over cyberattack", "published_date": "26 May 2023 ", "description": "UK regulatory body the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has said it is investigating the March cyberattack on Capita, which provides vital services to the government at top-notch rates.  Capita has already warned that it stands to  lose up to £20 million  ($25 million) after a data breach in March claimed by the ransomware group Black Basta.    Caught nodding, Capita didn’t notice the incident until the end of that month, nine days after its defenses were compromised. Earlier this month, the  Financial Times  reported that an estimated 470,000 people could have been left at risk from the cyberattack, despite it compromising only around a thousandth of Capita’s server estate.  “We are aware of two incidents concerning Capita, regarding a cyberattack in March and the use of publicly accessible storage,” said the ICO. “We are receiving a large number of reports from organisations directly affected by these incidents and we are currently making enquiries.”  The ICO, which reports directly to the UK Parliament and has a mandate to uphold digital information rights in the public interest, said it was encouraging any entity using Capita’s services “to check their own position regarding these incidents and determine if the personal data they hold has been affected.”  It added: “If necessary, consider reporting a data breach to the ICO and we will use this information to inform our next steps.”  The ICO stresses that any organization detecting a personal data breach must inform it within 72 hours, “unless it does not pose a risk to people’s rights and freedoms.”  “If an organisation decides that a breach doesn’t need to be reported, they should keep their own record of it and be able to explain why it wasn’t reported if necessary,” it said.  The declaration will not be welcome to Capita, which only yesterday boasted on its website of having secured two contracts with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for Communities (DfC), worth a whopping £565 million, to provide crucial services to people living with disabilities.  That same day, it also announced that it would be selling its OnePage service to ErisBerg. PageOne is described by Capita as “a leading provider of critical alerting and mobile messaging services” that enables better communications between service providers and recipients in both the public and private sectors.    Cybernews reached out to Capita, asking whether the ICO statement would impact either the sale price of PageOne or jeopardize the DWP and DfC contracts.  Capita said it had no further comment to add to its previous statements on the cyberattack, and said it had made “appropriate and timely contact with clients and all relevant regulators.”           More from Cybernews:  Capita hack to cost the company $25 million   China positioned to hack US railways and pipelines   TikTok tests out AI chatbot Tako   Earth’s largest solar telescope captures the Sun: 8 stunning new images   Pegasus spyware detected in Armenia and Azerbaijan      Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},

If convicted, they could be facing life behind bars.  Brian McDonald and Ciara Clutario, both 22 and of San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, are accused of racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of digital currency payments for selling fentanyl pills and cocaine to online buyers across the US.    McDonald was arrested on May 4th and is due to go before a federal court in central California next week, with Clutario’s trial expected to follow in the coming weeks.  Between April 2021 and the time of McDonald’s arrest, he and his accused accomplice allegedly used the dark web forums White House Market, ToRReZ, and AlphaBay to flog illegal drugs.  The US Department of Justice (DoJ), which announced the federal indictment on May 18th, claims that ‘business’ was so good that McDonald allegedly told an accomplice via SMS in June 2021 that he had “34 drug orders he had to fill.”  The previous month, just a week after allegedly setting up a darknet vendor profile to sell drugs, McDonald is said by the DoJ to have described his illegal business as “flourishing” in a text to Clutario.  Prosecutors say he followed this up in July of the same year with another message to Clutario, in which he said, “I’m really tryna make like 5 mil [sic].”  Proceeds from the drug sales were converted from Monero cryptocurrency, often favored by cybercriminals for transactions, into US dollars and kept by McDonald and Clutario at their homes, the DoJ alleges.  It further claims that McDonald protected these ill-gotten gains via the tried-and-tested means employed by conventional street drug dealers: two gold-plated firearms, one of which had no serial number.  “McDonald and Clutario allegedly monitored and maintained the darknet vendor profiles, including by updating drug listings and shipment options, tracking drug orders received online, and offloading Monero cryptocurrency received as drug-deal payments into cryptocurrency wallets that McDonald controlled,” said the DoJ.    It further alleges that McDonald hired accomplices, including Clutario, to package and ship the narcotics under his supervision after selling them to illicit customers on the dark web using the online aliases “Malachai Johnson,” “SouthSideOxy,” and “JefeDeMichoacan.”  If convicted, McDonald and Clutario face anywhere between ten years and life in prison.

{"title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer cyberattack halts newsroom", "published_date": "15 May 2023 ", "description": "The Philadelphia Inquirer, Pennsylvania’s largest news organization, was hit with a cyberattack, severely impacting its operations. The company says it‘s “unclear” when the issue will be resolved.  Attackers cut off the Inquirer’s staff from accessing its content-management system, a critical tool for publishing news stories, on Saturday (May 13) morning. The company immediately took down its IT systems and successfully found a workaround to post news stories online.  However, there was no easy way to bypass the attack when it came to printing the Sunday newspaper. According to Inquirer’s publisher Lisa Hughes, as of Monday, it’s unclear when the issue with the printing of the paper will be resolved.    “We appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding as we work to fully restore systems and complete this investigation as soon as possible,” Inquirer reported Hughes  saying .  The Philly news outlet also decided to bar staff from entering the office until Tuesday, as the “disruption” is ongoing. This is bad news for Pennsylvania-based journalists as May 16 marks the day of mayoral primary elections.  According to the Inquirer, the recent disruption is the largest since 1996, when the paper’s operations were shut down due to a major blizzard. The company said it notified the FBI’s Philly office about the incident.  While the attack’s nature is unclear, the timeline points to a  ransomware attack . Criminal syndicates target organizations with malware to disrupt their operations, demanding ransom for software that would allow them to resume operations.  According  to The State of Ransomware Report 2023 by cybersecurity company Sophos, ransom payments have increased “considerably” over the last year. The average payment nearly doubled and totals around $1.5 million in 2023, compared to $800,000 in 2022.  40% of victim organizations reported paying $1 million or more in ransom. The company experts warned that payments are just one element of recovery costs. Additional recovery costs – downtime, people time, device cost, network cost, and lost opportunity – stand at around $1.8 million.

{"title": "Austria next to ban TikTok", "published_date": "11 May 2023 ", "description": "Austria is the latest country in the European Union to ban TikTok from government devices over privacy concerns.   Austria’s Interior Minister Gerhard Karner announced the news just before a weekly cabinet meeting in Vienna Wednesday.  Karner said government politicians and employees would still be able to use the Chinese-owned video-sharing app outside of government offices on their personal devices.     \"It will be banned from work mobile phones. On private phones outside the state network it will of course be possible (to use the app),\" Karner said.   Austria joins a long list of Western nations that have already banned the app over security concerns, including the US, UK, Canada, France, Belgium, and Australia.   EU’s biggest executive and policymaking institutions – the European Parliament, European Commission and the EU Council – also banned  TikTok  this past spring.  TikTok has been under scrutiny by governments and regulators because of the large amounts of data collected and fears that ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, will be forced to turn over that data to the Communist regime as required by Chinese law.   In March, TikTok  CEO Shou Chew  appeared before US lawmakers in Washington DC to answer questions and try to convince officials that the massive amounts of data collected by the app do not violate the privacy of American users.   After intense questioning, US lawmakers were not impressed by Chew’s testimony and since have been debating legislation that would ban TikTok across the entire nation.   Perceived as a threat to US  national security , lawmakers worry that China is using the app to manipulate the American people and disseminate propaganda favorable to Chinese doctrine. They also cite concerns over the mental health of young children and teens.  At the time, TikTok boasted having over 150 million active US users per month – up 50 million since 2020.    Besides a TikTok  ban  on all federal devices, many US state governments have also banned use of TikTok among employees.   TikTok has  rejected  all claims of data-sharing practices with the Chinese government and said it has spent over $1.5 billion on rigorous data security efforts to appease the US.

On the notice to the affected clients on May 3rd, 2023, the Metropolitan Opera (the Met) stated that On December 6th, 2022, it identified suspicious activity related to its computer systems.   Investigations showed that malicious actors gained access to some of the Opera’s systems between September 30th, 2022, and December 6th, 2022, and stole customer data.     Sensitive data stolen Reportedly, the hackers were able to acquire sensitive information from the network, which included Financial Account Numbers and Credit/Debit Card Numbers, in combination with security codes, access codes, passwords, and PINs for accounts.  To mitigate the risk, the Met offered to provide credit monitoring services to affected individuals for 12 months free of charge, as well as consulting customers on identity theft and fraud prevention.  Investigation provided more details The Met is currently resident at the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, situated on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  The news about the cyberattack first broke in mid-December 2022, when  the Met  website was knocked out for at least five days.   The theatre couldn’t process new ticket orders or facilitate exchanges and refunds, yet all performances were able to take place as scheduled.  At the time, the Met did not provide more details about the cyberattack. On March 1st, the allegedly stolen data from the Met was uploaded to the dark web by the Snatch ransomware gang.      twitter              More from Cybernews: AI anxiety: getting to grips with an uncertain future  Threat actors exploiting interest in ChatGPT and AI, Meta says  Google promises \"passwordless future\" as it starts rolling out passkeys  Nigerian men charged with Instagram sextortion that led to teen suicide  Italy's ChatGPT ban lifted after OpenAI meets demands  Subscribe   to our   newsletter"},
{"title": "Apache, TP-Link, Oracle flaws exploited in the wild – CISA", "published_date": "02 May 2023 ", "description": "One critical and two high-severity vulnerabilities of TP-Link, Apache, and Oracle devices are being actively exploited by attackers, claims the agency.  The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added three bugs to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.  The first flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-1389, was assigned a score of 8.8 by the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD), indicating high severity. It affects the firmware of  TP-Link  Archer AX21 modems and “contains a command injection vulnerability.”    Attackers could use the flaw to instruct the devices to carry out malicious commands, potentially compromising the infrastructure linked with the modem.   According to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), a software vulnerability initiative curated by cybersecurity firm Trend Micro, the Mirai  botnet  has been leveraging the TP-Link flaw to  recruit  more devices to its ranks.  The second flaw, the Apache  Log4j2  deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-45046, was issued a score of 9.0, indicating critical severity.  This bug is particularly dangerous because threat actors can exploit it to transmit malicious data, instructing the app to run malicious code. The attack can lead to remote code execution (RCE) or even data loss.  The last flaw flagged by CISA, the Oracle WebLogic Server unspecified vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-21839, was given a 7.5 score, showcasing its high severity.  Oracle WebLogic Server platforms are designed to work with enterprise applications, such as Java, for on-premises and in the cloud. This bug would allow an attacker to access the system without any credentials or authentication.  A successful attack could allow threat actors to access critical data stored on the Oracle WebLogic Server, potentially leading to further attacks developed with the acquired information.  “These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,” CISA said in the  alert .

{"title": "Twitter’s blue check now badge of shame, subscribed by dead celebrities", "published_date": "25 April 2023 ", "description": "It’s safe to say Twitter’s big blue-tick transition hasn’t started off well. Anthony Bourdain, Kobe Bryant, and Chadwick Boseman were among celebrities who did subscribe to the paid service – except that they’re dead.  The celebrity chef, athlete, and actor died before Twitter Blue was turned into a paid service, and Elon Musk was not yet in charge of the platform.  It was precisely Musk’s idea to introduce the paid-subscription service that allows anyone to get a blue check mark by their display name if they pay $8 a month and confirm their phone number.    Previously, the blue tick was displayed only on legacy verified accounts, serving as proof that famous people, journalists, or politicians really are running said profiles. Everyone seemed happy – except Musk.  The billionaire, who bought Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, said the firm was losing money fast, fired thousands of employees, changed the way users’ timelines worked, and said it was time to monetize the platform.  Last week, Twitter  started removing check marks  from thousands of legacy verified accounts. Many profiles did lose the badges – but soon chaos, thus far typical to the Musk era, took hold.  First, Twitter started applying check marks to the accounts of many well-known people who didn’t actually pay for them and should have lost their badges – a lot of them,  including the writer Stephen King , then made sure to tell their followers that they took no steps to keep the tick.  Twitter then gave check marks to dead celebrities. The message attached to accounts of Bryant, Bourdain, Michael Jackson, the assassinated Japanese ex-prime minister Shinzo Abe, and others said: “This account is verified because they are subscribed to Twitter Blue and verified their phone number.\"    Kobe Bryan'ts account subscribed to Twitter Blue. Image by Cybernews.   It certainly is possible that people managing a deceased person’s account had paid for Twitter Blue. But most of the profiles are inactive because, well, the people owning them had died.  Living celebrities gifted the check mark have now been trying to shake off the impression that they paid for the privilege: it now seems to be something one would not want to show off.             For example, actor Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf in  The Lord of the Rings  and  The Hobbit  trilogies,  wrote : “Despite the implication when you click the blue badge that has mysteriously re-appeared beside my name, I am not paying for the honour.\"  Twitter’s  Help Center specifies  that accounts that get the check mark as part of their Twitter Blue subscription “will not undergo review to confirm that they meet the active, notable and authentic criteria that was used in the previous process.”   Experts have warned that this could increase the risk of impersonation and accelerate the spread of misinformation on Twitter. As if to highlight the dangers itself, Twitter gave the gold check mark to a fake “DisneyJuniorUK” account that had posted racist slurs over the weekend.

{"title": "Over 100 secret Chinese police stations operating worldwide", "published_date": "21 April 2023 ", "description": "Just days after the FBI busted up a secret Chinese police force operating in NYC, information has resurfaced documenting six more secret police stations being run in the US, and almost 100 more operating in major cities worldwide.   Safeguard Defenders, a small human rights group located in Madrid, has been documenting the presence of dozens of Chinese government-sponsored police stations across the globe since 2014.  The organization published several in-depth reports on the Communist regime’s secret stations in 2022.     Two reports,  110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild  and its follow-up  Patrol and Persuade , both released this past fall, revealed a total of 102 clandestine Chinese police stations operating in 53 counties across the world.   The overseas locations include such major metropolitan western cities as Montreal, London, Dublin, Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Prague, Budapest, and Stockholm.   Many of the stations were said to have been recently set up during the Covid 19 pandemic.   The  reports  also identified a second unknown NYC location, as well as five other stations operating in the US, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and cities in Nebraska and Minnesota.   Besides North America and Europe, stations were also found in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceana, including Tokyo, Sydney and New Zealand.     Patrol and Persuade, Safeguard Defenders   The stations are known to operate under the direction of the People’s Republic of China through China’s national police force, Ministry of Public Security (MPS).  The PCR back stations are often established under the false pretenses of helping to provide supportive services to local Chinese residents living in the area.    But the real goal, according to reports, is to locate Chinese dissidents – considered “wanted fugitives” by the PRC – living abroad and force them to return to the homeland.   Often times this is accomplished through involuntary means, which can even include kidnapping, according to the Safeguard Defenders investigations.   Once a secret station is established in a foreign nation, the MPS officers will use any means to threaten, harass, and intimidate their targets.  “Sometimes Chinese nationals abroad are forced to return because the Embassy refuses their request to renew their passports, others are targeted via cyber-attacks and harassment,” according to the group’s January 2022 report,  Involuntary Returns .   The clandestine operations are directly connected to the PRC’s “912 Special Project Working Group,” whose sole purpose is to target Chinese dissidents located throughout the world, including in the US.  The arrested New York City-based  MPS officers  are accused of creating thousands of fake online personas on social media sites, such as Twitter, using temporary email addresses to not only target dissidents but disseminate official PRC government propaganda.  The officers also attempted to recruit U.S. persons to act as unwitting agents of the PCR and go after the targeted individuals.  The FBI said the 44 defendants charged this week in New York City established the Chinatown-based police station in February 2022, the first overseas MPS police station set up in the US.  The lower Manhattan station was shut down by the fall of 2022 after those operating it became aware of the FBI’s investigation.   A spokesman for the China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the US charges “groundless accusations.”    “The relevant claims have no factual basis, and there is no such thing as an overseas police station,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said following the FBI arrests.    110 Overseas, Safeguard Defenders   The PCR missive, also known as Operation Fox Hunt, is carried out by the Chinese government “legally or illegally, with the host country’s permission or undercover,” the human rights report stated.  Operation Fox Hunt is also not new to the White House, according to the Safeguard Defenders report.   In 2015, Washington accused Beijing of regularly “sending Chinese agents to the US on tourist or business visas to covertly track down and repatriate fugitives on US soil.”  The report states that in 2015, one former Fox Hunt director was quoted as saying, “Whether or not there is an agreement in place, as long as there is information that there is a criminal suspect, we will chase them over there, we will take our work to them, anywhere.”  The PRC has claimed at least in Africa and Asia, the stations have been set up in explicit agreement with the host countries.   “These cases demonstrate the lengths the PRC government will go to silence and harass U.S. persons who exercise their fundamental rights to speak out against PRC oppression, including by unlawfully exploiting a U.S.-based technology company,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the US Justice Department’s National Security Division.  “These actions violate our laws and are an affront to our democratic values and basic human rights,\" Olsen said.

{"title": "Twitter recommendation algorithm revealed", "published_date": "04 April 2023 ", "description": "The Twitterverse responds as Elon Musk follows through on his promise to open up Twitter’s source code for developers worldwide. Musk announces it’s all happening at 12 noon Pacific time (3 pm ET), Friday.   The tech mogul tweeted the news to his 133.1 million follower just after midnight March 31.   Musk had publicly promised he would decentralize the social messaging app’s platform since he took over the company for  $44 billion  in October.     “Algorithm goes open source at noon Pacific Time,” Musk's tweet said.     twitter     Opening Twitter’s source code for software developers to tweak, analyze, and most certainly criticize on a world stage is apt to mesmerize a captive audience of Musk followers for years to come.   The Twitter CEO had been hinting about a March 31 reveal on his Twitter account over the past few months, but many industry insiders were unsure if it was just a ploy to appease those critical of Musk’s handling of the company so far.   One Twitter user from Australia, simply named Will, praised the announcement, tweeting that the move will make Twitter “THE most trusted social media platform ever!!  The user succinctly explained what the term open source meant to other followers.   “Open sourcing it means it can be audited by experts and there will be a free feedback loop with suggestions on errors and improvements.. Its also about letting people know how they are being prioritized,” the user wrote.   “Its about open authentic communication . No ones ever done it before.. It means it will be THE most trusted social media platform ever!!,” the tweet said.       twitter     But as expected, some felt Musk was just trying to placate the masses and absolve himself and his platform from past accusations of biased  content control  and mistakenly shadowbanning some Twitter users based on their political and social views.  Luke Zaleski, Legal Affairs Editor at Condé Nast, tweeted a lengthy rant accusing Musk of trying to convince the public of his objectivity, pointing out Musk's anti-vax stance and appearances at Trump support rallies show the opposite.   “Elon’s hustle…open/out-sourcing the accuracy/moderation of his $44 billion baby absolves him of responsibility for bias, but Twitter is Elon. This is a closed loop, “ Zaleski tweeted.   “The subject and the source. Elon = twitter. He’s the biggest account. And he’s the boss. And he refuses to concede his own biases exist,” the tweet continued.   “He knows he can manipulate his personal platform to be in a position powerful enough to crown kings, pick presidents and help produce whatever personal or political outcome he wants,“ Zaleski concluded.     twitter     A controversy erupted on the topic in February after an alleged Twitter employee revealed that  Musk  ordered engineers to tweak the website’s algorithms to promote his own tweets over the tweets of other Twitter users.   The leak followed previous rumors that Musk  fired  another one of his top engineers for commenting to Musk that his tweet views were declining because people were no longer interested in what he had to say.   And just last week, another leak – thought to be a possible pay-back for Musk’s recent spate of  layoffs  and firings – caused parts of Twitter’s source code to be published on the popular developer forum Github.    Twitter filed an injunction in a California district court last week forcing Github to remove the post.   Twitter has since obtained a  subpoena  to force Github to reveal the true identity of the source code leaker.   The court deadline for the reveal is Monday, April 3.

{"title": "Nigerian gangster jailed for $1m cyber-fraud", "published_date": "28 March 2023 ", "description": "A Nigerian gang member has been sentenced to four years in an American jail for taking part in online scams that targeted US citizens and banks that could have caused up to $1 million in losses to victims.  Solomon Ekunke Okpe, 31, of Lagos, was handed the prison term after being extradited from Malaysia, where he was arrested, to the US to stand trial.    Okpe and his accomplices “devised and executed  business email compromise  (BEC), work-from-home, check-cashing, romance, and credit card scams” between 2011 and 2017, said the US Department of Justice (DoJ), announcing the sentence.  Targeted victims included individuals, banks, and businesses in the US and other countries, who were subjected to email phishing attacks aimed at stealing login credentials and “other sensitive information.”  The DoJ described the scams as “intended to cause more than $1 million in losses to US victims” although it is not clear if this nefarious goal was achieved by the cyber-fraud gang.  Bogus personas In addition, Okpe and his fellow crooks “hacked into victim online accounts, impersonated people, and assumed fake identities to defraud individuals, banks, and businesses, and trafficked, possessed, and used stolen credit cards in furtherance of the scheme.”  The impostors then tricked banks and other organizations into “making unauthorized wire transfers to bank accounts specified by the co-conspirators.”  The DoJ added: “The co-conspirators also falsely posed as online employers on job websites and forums and purported to ‘hire’ individuals in Arizona and elsewhere to positions that were marketed as legitimate.”  These victims in fact became dupes who were manipulated into supporting Okpe’s gang in their criminal activities, although at the time they believed they were merely carrying out legal work duties.    “Some of these tasks included creating bank and payment processing accounts, transferring/withdrawing money from these accounts, or cashing/depositing counterfeit checks,” said the DoJ.  Love-rats Another favored tactic of Okpe and his accomplices was the tried-and-tested “romance scam” in which the culprits pretended to be looking for love on the internet to hoodwink further victims out of their money and solicit their help in moving around cash stolen in other crimes.  They did this “by creating accounts on dating websites, feigning interest in romantic relationships with individuals under fictitious identities, and causing these victims to transfer their money overseas or receive money from wire-transfer scams.”  The DoJ added that some of Okpe’s victims in these scams lost tens of thousands of dollars.  Okpe now joins his fellow gang member Johnson Uke Obogo behind bars, although he will likely only have the latter’s company for a fraction of his own sentence. Obogo was sentenced on March 20 to a year and a day in prison for his role in the scams, a considerably shorter tariff than Okpe’s.  Financial institutions named by the DoJ as victims include “First American Holding Company and MidFirst Bank.”  The detail is intriguing, as the department does not usually specify victims in such cases. Also, it is unclear if the first company mentioned by the DoJ exists under that precise name or whether the department referred to it as such in error.

{"title": "ChatGPT: how OpenAI’s bot is used in war-torn Ukraine", "published_date": "16 March 2023 ", "description": "As ChatGPT, the machine learning-powered chatbot from OpenAI, finally becomes available in Ukraine, we look at its practical uses in the country that has been countering Russian aggression for over a year.  The artificial intelligence (AI) program or bot that provides articulate responses to user prompts across various topics has been experimented with by users all over the world since November – but Ukrainians are only starting to test it now.  A thorny path    Up until February, ChatGPT was blocked in Ukraine. It remains unavailable in Russia, China, Afghanistan, Belarus, Venezuela, and Iran. Usually, it's unclear why the developer blocks access in some locations, but in this case, OpenAI came back with a letter addressed to Ukraine’s Ministry of Digitization explaining its position.  Allegedly, the cited reason concerned sanctions that apply to the Russian-occupied Luhansk and Donetsk regions, as well as the annexed Crimea. Previously, OpenAI told Motherboard that certain countries make it difficult or impossible for the company to provide its services in a way that is consistent with its mission.  Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Bornyakov  told  Forbes that sanctions related to the occupied territories forced the block as “they don’t know how to distinguish them from clients [who are] from the rest of Ukraine.”  Ukrainians, however, were excited about the prospects of ChatGPT, with Mykhailo Fedorov, who serves as Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, saying:  “Ukrainians are tech-savvy, cool, and ready to test innovations now. Personally [I] will use your tool to make my Twitter account great again.”    twitter     After official appeals, calls, and even a meeting with the management on behalf of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, ChatGPT has finally become available in Ukraine. Restricted access will still apply to occupied territories, to prevent disinformation.  Shortly after the update, Ukrainian site designer Weblium added the functionality known as “AI writing,” which allows users to access ChatGPT directly during site creation.    ChatGPT is now available in Ukrainian, with users eager to make full use of the chatbot – often in spite of OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s warning that ChatGPT is incredibly limited and should not be relied on for “important” things just yet.    twitter     ChatGPT offers to stop war in eight steps We can safely assume that the last thing Ukrainians expected from access to OpenAI’s chatbot is a step-by-step guide on how to resolve the conflict with Russia.  But here it is: an eight-point solution provided at the request of author and former Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup, who asked for a mediation plan.  ChatGPT acknowledged that the ongoing war is a complex issue, but offered eight of its possible solutions with descriptions: Negotiations, Ceasefire, Decentralisation, International Monitoring, Economic Assistance, Recognition of the Sovereignty of Ukraine, Cultural Protection, and Military Withdrawal.  The program laid out a framework for finding common ground and setting up the path to future cooperation, with additional financial support for Ukraine issued by institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.    twitter     Shashi Tharoor, the chairman of the All India Professionals' Congress (AIPC), India’s political platform focused on entrepreneurs, praised the experiment but cautioned against relying on ChatGPT’s advice as “in conflicts leaders are irrational in ways beyond AI’s comprehension.” He also added that he envisions a “several objections” from both sides, but especially, the Russians.  Ukraine has greatly relied AI to target Russian forces, with the CEO of US software firm Palantir, Alex Karp, pointing out how the use of wartime AI has become the top concern since the outbreak of full hostilities. According to him, it is not an “ethics issue” anymore but a top concern for all leaders around the globe.    As such, Ukraine has started using Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology to uncover Russian assailants, combat misinformation, and identify the dead.  So it only seems to be a matter of time until ChatGPT can find its place in Ukraine for better information sharing and education during the conflict. However, Daniel Spicer, a chief security officer at the software company Ivanti,  told Cybernews  that ChatGPT “doesn't know what a fact is,” highlighting its potential for misinformation which still needs to be addressed.   The geoblocks in place also seem to be of little use against Russian hackers eager to circumvent them, according to Check Point Research (CPR). Cybercriminals have been noticed lurking around dark-web forums, discussing options for bypassing restrictions and utilizing the program.  AI, keep my records in check Yet, ChatGPT’s popularity goes beyond commercial or even war-related use. Some Ukrainian officials are  utilizing OpenAI’s bot  for their benefit – regardless of how trivial it might be.   Tymofiy Mylovanov, a Ukrainian economist and former Minister of Economic Development, Trade, and Agriculture of Ukraine uses ChatGPT to keep transcripts of conversations with colleagues. The process looks pretty straightforward: he records nearly every business meeting and sends the copy to ChatGPT, receiving a transcript within 60 seconds.  The AI bot also prepares a short summary of conversations and upon request will recap any and all agreements reached at meetings. Following a brief editing session, Mylovanov receives “a high-quality meeting post, an action plan, [details of] responsible parties, deadlines, and so on.”  “So my meetings now look like this: 15 minutes of discussion, 10 minutes of processing the transcript, another 10-15 minutes of discussion with the team to agree on the final action plan, and so forth. In my experience, this significantly improves the team's understanding of what was specifically agreed at the meeting, and who does what or is responsible for what.”  Companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, Verizon, and Accenture have reportedly banned their staff from using ChatGPT at work or directly sharing any sensitive information with it, citing security concerns.   Universities and schools around the world have also joined in with the ban,  barring  students and pupils from using the AI bot, which they argue could be used for cheating and spreading misinformation.    Nonetheless, Ukrainian users are excited about the prospects of ChatGPT, with its utility likely relying on updates and the verification of displayed information.

{"title": "Swiss cybersecurity firm Acronis breached, claims hacker", "published_date": "10 March 2023 ", "description": "A Swiss cybersecurity firm that employs more than 2,000 workers has been hacked, according to a dark-web claim shared on social media by a threat watcher. Acronis has confirmed that customer credentials were compromised but insists that none of its products have been affected.  FalconFeedsio used Twitter to post the claims by an unspecified hacker that they had breached Acronis and leaked data stolen from the digital security company on a dark-web forum.    According to Falcon’s tweet, the data includes certificate files, command logs, system configurations, and file system archives. The threat watcher shared the original dark-web post from the hacker claiming responsibility, in which they name the alleged victim.  “Today I’m leaking details of a cybersecurity company called Acronis,” said the hacker, adding a smily emoji for emphasis.  “User in the hacker's forum claims to have leaked data from a Switzerland cybersecurity company,” tweeted Falcon. “The leaked data includes various certificate files, command logs, system configurations, system information logs, archives of their file system, Python scripts for their maria.db database, backup configuration stuff, and loads of screenshots of their backup operations.”    twitter     “For transparency, the specific credentials used by only one customer to upload diagnostic data to an Acronis file server was compromised, no Acronis products have been affected. Our customer service team is currently working with this customer. Updates to follow as needed,” Acronis told Cybernews in a tweet.  Shortly after sharing the revelation about Acronis, Falcon posted again to say that a pro-Russian threat actor claimed to have breached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Latvia - a staunch NATO ally opposed to the invasion of Ukraine.  “NoName hackers group claims to have targeted and attacked portal of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia,” said Falcon.  NoName hacking group is believed to have emerged last year shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, and is thought to be going after government, media, and other targets in the latter country as well as the US and European nations.      twitter              More from Cybernews:  LockBit adds Audio-Technica to victim list  TikTok suffers an outage   US cyber general warns Russia is not to be underestimated  ChatGPT Chrome extension pilfers Facebook accounts  Canadian engineering giant with military ties hit by ransomware   Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "Flaw spotted in the US government’s quantum-safe encryption algorithm", "published_date": "07 March 2023 ", "description": "CRYSTALS-Kyber, a cryptographic algorithm the US chose to quantum-proof its systems, might harbor a previously unknown vulnerability, researchers claim.  Researchers from Sweden’s KTH Royal Institute of Technology claim they devised a way to decrypt information hidden using CRYSTALS-Kyber via a side-channel attack.  To perform such an attack, threat actors take advantage of information gathered from the physical environment of a system to gain access to sensitive data.     Examples of these physical clues include power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, sounds, or timing data. In essence, the attackers look for physical residue by using a cryptographic algorithm.  “Such a method allows us to train neural networks that can recover a message bit with the probability above 99% from high-order masked implementations,” researchers  claim .  If the research paper passed peer review, that might spell bad news for Washington. Last July, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  selected CRYSTALS-Kyber  for standardization as a public-key encryption mechanism.  Researchers employed neural networks to penetrate the algorithm’s defenses. Specifically, they employed recursive learning to train the network to recognize specific data masking patterns CRYSTALS-Kyber uses.

{"title": "More bad news from LastPass: corporate vault taken", "published_date": "28 February 2023 ", "description": "The large data breach that LastPass suffered last year, when hackers stole copies of its customers’ vaults, has already shaken trust in password managers. Now, there’s more.  LastPass disclosed in December 2022 that a severe data breach allowed threat actors to access encrypted password vaults, take the data, and then try to decrypt it.   The August incident left the password manager, worryingly late to report it, struggling to maintain its slick reputation. A survey of over a thousand Americans by Security.org, a website that tests cybersecurity products,  said  LastPass slipped from being the most popular manager in 2021 to fourth place in 2022.    LastPass now has more to say, and it’s even more concerning. It turns out that the same adversary launched another attack on the company’s systems.  The initial intrusion into LastPass ended on August 12. But the company now says that the threat actor “was actively engaged in a new series of reconnaissance, enumeration, and exfiltration activity” from August 12 to October 26.  In the process, the attacker hacked an employee’s home computer and obtained a decrypted vault available to only a few staff members. Said worker was one of its DevOps engineers.  \"The threat actor leveraged information stolen during the first incident, information available from a third-party data breach, and a vulnerability in a third-party media software package, to launch a coordinated second attack,\" the password management service  said .          Once in possession of the decrypted vault, the threat actor exported the entries, including the “decryption keys needed to access the AWS S3 LastPass production backups, other cloud-based storage resources, and some related critical database backups.”  LastPass’s update said that the tactics, techniques, and procedures used in the first incident were different from those used in the second. That’s why it wasn’t initially clear to investigators that the two were directly related.   Last year LastPass claimed no data had been breached, and that turned out not to be true. Experts were and remain extremely critical of the company for not being more honest about the impact of the hack in its disclosures.    When LastPass decided to disclose the real scale of the breach, most experts urged the firm’s customers to change their master passwords and all passwords stored in their vaults. The threat actor may not have accessed either, but it’s  better  to be safe than sorry.  “When selecting a password manager, choose one that works across all of your platforms and devices and encrypts all of the data in your vault. And be sure that you choose a strong and unique main password for your password manager itself, to keep your credentials secure,” Gary Orenstein, chief customer officer at password management service provider Bitwarden  told  Cybernews in January.

Lakewood is a city in Pierce County, Washington, with a population of over 63,000. BlackCat claimed it had breached Lakewood City Council and stolen over 250GB worth of data.  “Because of their misunderstanding and inability to negotiate, we share information with you,” BlackCat said and shared a link to download 252GB of documents.

Two city governments in California - Oakland and Modesto - were knocked offline in simultaneous ransomware attacks this week, forcing police in one city to fall back on “old school policing,” including the use of handheld radios, pens, and paper during patrols.   Oakland officials have confirmed a ransomware attack on municipal networks.     Government officials, posted a  statement  on the city’s website Friday after rumors starting swirling on social media about certain city services not working.   “The City of Oakland has learned that it was recently subject to a ransomware attack that began on Wednesday night. The Information Technology Department is coordinating with law enforcement and actively investigating the scope and severity of the issue. Our core functions are intact. 911, financial data, and fire and emergency resources are not impacted.” the statement read.   As a precautionary measure, all affected city services were taken offline while investigators and security experts work to restore the system.   “The public should expect delays from the City as a result. We are actively monitoring the situation and sending updated information as it becomes available” stated Oakland officials.   Meanwhile, the Modesto hack forced their local police department to revert to using handheld radios, pens, and paper while patrolling the city, as first reported by McClatchy news organization.  Apparently the police computer outage has been going on for a number of days causing the department to embrace “old school policing,” reported one anonymous source.  Modesto is “experiencing limited connectivity to some systems. Our ability to facilitate city services including emergency service and answer 911 calls is fully operational,”   according to a statement by Modesto officials  Thursday.  A ransomware attack has not been publicly confirmed, but Modesto officials did verify they had detected “suspicious activity” within its networks.     “Upon learning of this suspicious activity, we strategically disconnected portions of our network out of an abundance of caution. We have also initiated an investigation with leading cyber security experts,” officials stated.  The two cities are located roughly an hour and half apart.

{"title": "Researcher successfully hacked Toyota’s global network", "published_date": "08 February 2023 ", "description": "A Florida-based cybersecurity researcher had a slow week in late October 2022 and decided to inspect the systems of various major companies for exploits. In a week, he detected four different security issues at Toyota, all of which he deemed critical.  Eaton Zveare, Director of Technology at Grape Intentions, an online wine store, has a personal website where he writes about various cybersecurity projects he pursues in his free time.  Last October, Zveare decided to “explore the subdomains of various major companies to see if I could find any exploits worth reporting/writing about.”     When he found several interesting Toyota websites, it took the researcher a mere week to detect and report four different “critical” security issues to the Japanese car manufacturer. “One of the reports had a remarkably severe impact and is one of the most severe vulnerabilities I have ever found,” Zveare  wrote  in his blog.  What he meant was that he had hacked Toyota’s Global Supplier Preparation Information Management System – a web app used by the company’s employees and their suppliers to coordinate projects, purchases, and other tasks related to the global Toyota supply chain.     A web app of Toyota’s Global Supplier Preparation Information Management System. Courtesy of eaton-works.com.   The hack was quite easy to execute. Zveare says he discovered a backdoor login mechanism in the website, and this allowed him to log in as any corporate Toyota user or supplier just by knowing their email. What happened next was entirely unsurprising.  “I eventually uncovered a system administrator email and was able to log in to their account. Once that was done, I had full control over the entire global system. I had full access to internal Toyota projects, documents, and user accounts, including user accounts of Toyota’s external partners/suppliers,” the researcher said.  These external accounts included users from companies such as Michelin, Continental, Stanley Black & Decker, Timken, and others.  The issue was reported to Toyota on November 3, who responded later that same day, confirming they received the report. Twenty days later, the firm announced the issue was fixed.  However, Zveare thinks that if a threat actor had discovered the problem, “the consequences could have been severe.” For an obvious instance, they could have downloaded and leaked all the data, deleted it, or modified it to disrupt global Toyota operations.    Finally, a threat actor could have crafted a highly targeted phishing campaign to attempt to capture corporate login details. This would probably have exposed other Toyota systems to attack.  “It’s one thing to have 14k+ corporate emails, but it’s another to have 14k+ corporate emails and know exactly what they are working on/have worked on. If a supplier user has a habit of reusing passwords, it’s possible their own infrastructure could be attacked too,” the researcher said.   As Cybernews recently  reported , security researchers discovered severe vulnerabilities in Ferrari, BMW, Toyota, Ford, and other automotive companies.  According to the  researchers , Toyota Financial’s Insecure direct object references (IDOR) – a vulnerability that arises from  broken access control  in web applications – discloses the name, phone number, email address, and loan status of any Toyota financial customers.

Signal jammers were put up signal jammers all over central Volgograd, denying locals mobile internet access. Roskomsvoboda, a Russian organization for protecting digital rights, linked connection disruption with the visit of the Kremlin’s master.  Volgograd, called Stalingrad during the Soviet Era, celebrated the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad. Russia’s president Putin took part in events marking the end of the bloody battle that resulted in around 2 million casualties during the Second World War.    According to the Faridaily Telegram channel, the city’s center was cleared of all traffic, banning citizens from visiting public memorials during the president’s visit.  “This is a Putin-style national celebration of the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad. No real citizens, no Internet, and with everyone’s hands at the seams,” Faridaily Telegram channel said.          Signs touting the city’s soviet-era name were put up throughout Volgograd. The town also had a monument to the soviet dictator Stalin erected.  According to Reuters, despite Stalin’s record of presiding over a famine that killed millions and political repression that killed hundreds of thousands, Russian politicians and school textbooks stress his role as a successful wartime leader.  Last February, Russia started a full-scale war against Ukraine, invading the country with hundreds of thousands of troops. Despite initial plans to take Ukraine’s capital Kyiv in three days, the Russian military finds itself in a year-long war with casualties in the hundreds of thousands.

Indianapolis Housing Agency (IHA), a federally-funded government housing agency that provides low-income families access to affordable housing, started sending out letters to thousands of affected residents.  According to the letter, IHA noticed “unusual activity” in the organization’s IT systems on October 24, 2022. Later investigation determined that IHA became a victim of a ransomware attack.    The letter IHA sent to users says there’s no evidence that threat actors “actually used or misused” the data they have obtained via the attack.

{"title": "EU fines Meta millions for breaking GDPR rules", "published_date": "20 January 2023 ", "description": "Social media giant Meta has been again fined by the EU for breaking the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules – this time, on its WhatsApp instant messaging service. Critics say it’s not enough.  Meta will have to pay €5.5 million ($5.9 million), the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), where the company has its EU headquarters, announced on Thursday.  The fine is related to intentionally designed pop-up messages that Meta used to show to WhatsApp users in recent years. These prompts were urging people to accept Meta’s new Terms of Service or else be unable to access WhatsApp.    The GDPR was just about to come into operation in 2018, and WhatsApp used the occasion to inform users that they had to click “agree and continue” if they wanted to use the app following the introduction of the GDPR.   The statement of the DPC now  says  that WhatsApp Ireland took the position that “the processing of users’ data in connection with the delivery of its service was lawful and necessary for the performance of that contract to include the provision of service improvement and security features.”  However, a complainant in Germany – a data subject – contended that the company was in fact “seeking to rely on consent to provide a lawful basis for its processing of users’ data.” In other words, WhatsApp Ireland was “forcing” users to consent to the processing of personal data and, thus, breaching the GDP.  The DPC said in its decision that Meta relied on an incorrect legal basis \"for its processing of personal data for the purposes of service improvement and security.” The company was also found to have acted “in breach of its obligations in relation to transparency.”  The watchdog also directed WhatsApp to bring its data processing operations into compliance within six months. According to Reuters, a spokesperson for WhatsApp said it intended to appeal the decision and that it strongly believed that the way its service operates is both technically and legally compliant.          What’s more, not only WhatsApp is unhappy. The complainant, a privacy group NOYB, on Thursday  criticized  the size of the latest fine and slammed the DPC for ignoring other issues with how WhatsApp uses data for advertising purposes.   \"We are astonished how the DPC simply ignores the core of the case after a 4.5-year procedure,\" said NOYB founder Max Schrems who also said that the DPC “clearly” ignored the binding decision of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).    According to NOYB, the core matter of data use for \"the purposes of behavioral advertising, for marketing purposes, as well as for the provision of metrics to third parties and the exchange of data with affiliated companies \" were not dealt with by the Irish DPC – despite a binding decision of the EDPB that these matters must be investigated.   Earlier this month, Meta was  fined  €390 million (over $400 million) for breaches of EU data privacy rules relating to Facebook and Instagram.   The DPC also fined WhatsApp €225 million ($ 244 million) in September 2021 for breaches that occurred in May 2018, the same period of time as the complaint dealt with on Thursday. According to Reuters, Meta’s fines by Ireland’s Data Privacy Commissioner (DPC) have already reached around €1 billion ($1.08 billion).  WhatsApp is in the process of appealing that fine through the Irish courts. In December 2022, the company also had to deal with a big data leak  investigated  by the Cybernews Research team.

The core issue around the law is that in its current form, it criminalizes certain activities that penetration testers, who are nowadays recognized as the backbone of cybersecurity efforts to test defenses among organizations from ransomware attacks and the like, say they need to carry out to ensure safety.  CyberUp describes these activities as being a “large proportion of the vulnerability and cyber threat intelligence research that they are able to do” and has been making a case for reform of the law since 2019 – so far to little or no avail, despite a Home Office review of the legislation in 2021 that led to the pledge to re-evaluate the Act.  It now hopes that with nonprofit organization CREST on board, its campaign will take on the necessary urgency to compel the UK government to finally deliver on its promises.  “The CyberUp Campaign is delighted to have CREST International on board as a supporter,” said a spokesperson. “We are very much looking forward to working with CREST and its members in the UK to ensure the reform of the Computer Misuse Act. The UK is on the precipice of a historic change in our cyber crime laws. Help from organisations like CREST is essential if we are to make sure this once-in-a-generation opportunity does not go to waste.”  Describing the Computer Misuse Act as “out of date” and taking a “view of security testing and threat intelligence not fit for today’s increasingly digitized world”, Rob Dartnall, Chair of CREST’s UK Council, added: “In 2021 CyberUp secured a comprehensive review of the Act so it is now important for industry in the UK to collaborate to ensure substantial reform happens. We will be working with the campaign to help engage industry and drive forward successful reform.”           More from Cybernews: Nick Cave calls ChatGPT “grotesque mockery”   HR platform’s data leak turns into privacy nightmare for employees  eToro denies data breach  Netflix to crack down on account sharing  Artist builds GPT-3 typewriter that replies to you on paper  Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},

{"title": "Google pays $29.5 million in location tracking lawsuits", "published_date": "02 January 2023 ", "description": "Google settled two lawsuits paying $9.5m and $20m over claims the company tracked its user’s location without their consent.  The tech giant settled lawsuits from Indiana and Washington, DC, over ‘deceptive and unfair’ whereabouts monitoring practices. Lawsuits from both states alleged that Google tracked user location without their permission.  “My office reached a settlement with Google requiring the company to pay $9.5 million for deceiving and manipulating consumers—including by using “dark patterns” to trick users and gain access to their location data,” DC Attorney General Karl Racine said in a tweet.    Apart from coughing up close to $30m, Google  pledged  to issue a pop-up notification to users with location history or app activity enabled at the time of notification. The company will also disclose whether app settings allow the company to collect location information.  Last November, Google  agreed to a record $391.5 million multistate settlement , which also requires the company to be more transparent about location tracking and limits Google’s use and storage of certain types of location information.  Google used to enable Web & App Activity settings for every user setting up a Google account. The settings allowed the company to collect location data. Authorities claimed that in doing so, the company violated state consumer protection laws since 2014.

{"title": "LastPass tells world more about recent breach, researchers frustrated", "published_date": "23 December 2022 ", "description": "LastPass, a password manager with over 25 million users, gave more details about the latest breach into the company’s systems. The firm claims users’ personal data or master passwords were not affected – yet researchers are worried.  In a blog post, Karim Touba, Chief Executive of LastPass, once again confirmed that a threat actor had recently gained access to a third-party cloud-based storage service, which LastPass uses to store backups of its production data.   The company had earlier said that the attacker used information obtained in the August 2022  incident , and now has decided to share what exactly was stolen or copied. Details are worrying.     What the company claims Kouba once again said that in the August breach, no customer data was accessed. However, the threat actor stole “some source code and technical information from our development environment.”  This data was used to target another employee. After obtaining the needed credentials and keys, attackers accessed and decrypted “some storage volumes” within the cloud-based storage service where backups are held.  What’s concerning is the type of information that was copied. LastPass says the backup contained “basic customer account information and related metadata including company names, end-user names, billing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and the IP addresses from which customers were accessing the LastPass service.”  The attackers were also able to copy a backup of customer vault data from the encrypted storage container which is stored in a proprietary binary format that contains both unencrypted data, such as website URLs, as well as fully-encrypted sensitive fields such as website usernames and passwords, secure notes, and form-filled data.    \"The unencrypted URL breach is bad news for your security model, and you should be thinking about mitigations,”   John Scott-Railton, Senior Researcher at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto   Of course, LastPass stresses that the encrypted fields remain secure – they can only be decrypted with a unique key derived from each user’s master password. The latter is never known to LastPass and is not stored or maintained by the company.  What does it actually mean?    And yet, experts seem to be very frustrated. After all, when LastPass says that hackers were able to “copy a backup of customer vault data” – and that’s exactly what the firm says – it means that the threat actor theoretically now has access to all those passwords. Of course, if the attacker can crack the stolen vaults.  Yes, LastPass claims there’s nothing to worry about if your master password is strong: “Because of the hashing and encryption methods we use to protect our customers, it would be extremely difficult to brute force guess master passwords for those customers who follow our password best practices.”          “If you use the default settings above, it would take millions of years to guess your master password using generally-available password-cracking technology,” the company adds.  But what if the “best practices'' are by chance – and a fat one at that because it’s often hard to keep up with the most recent settings – not followed? What if the master password is weak or older?  LastPass has an answer: “In this case, as an extra security measure, you should consider minimizing risk by changing passwords of websites you have stored.” Yes, that means password changes for every website you trusted LastPass to store – and that’s a lot of fuss.  Frustration abounds There’s more, though. LastPass admits that some unencrypted data was stolen, and that includes website URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). This is important as hackers would actually know which websites users have accounts with and target them with phishing or other types of attacks.  According to John Scott-Railton, Senior Researcher at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, LastPass now “has a giant target on their back because of the juicy data $ password trove that they handle, and they are absolutely failing their customers.”  “Attackers didn't just get encrypted passwords. They got unencrypted URLs. Think: URLs with account tokens, API keys & credentials, etc.,” the researcher wrote.    “Do your employees use LastPass? Or how about your users? Do you even know? The unencrypted URL breach is bad news for your security model, and you should be thinking about mitigations.”  Alison Gianotto, the founder of Snipe-IT, an open-source asset management firm, called the situation at LastPass a mess. She already told her LastPass-using employees to expect to get phishing emails, some of which might actually cite the LastPass breach as a reason to click on their links.     To be fair, Eva Galperin, Director of Cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit defending civil liberties in the digital world, urged tweeple not to cancel their password manager subscriptions.  “Pour one out for all of the security practitioners who are going to have to patiently explain that using a password manager is still good, actually, to people who have glanced at a headline about the latest LastPass breach,” she wrote.

{"title": "Fortnite game maker to pay $520m over children’s privacy violations", "published_date": "20 December 2022 ", "description": "Epic Games, the video game company behind the hugely popular Fortnite online romp, agrees to pay more than half a billion dollars in penalties for collecting data on children and deceptive practices.  The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said Monday in a  statement  that it had secured the record-breaking settlements for two cases from Epic Games, the video game company that was bombarded with complaints involving children’s privacy and methods that tricked players into making purchases.  Epic Games agreed to pay a $275m fine for collecting personal data on Fortnite players under the age of 13 without informing their parents or getting their consent. This is the biggest penalty ever issued for breaking an FTC rule.    “Epic used privacy-invasive default settings that harmed young Fortnite players,” said FTC Chair Lina Khan.   “Protecting the public, and especially children and teens, from online privacy invasions is a top priority for the Commission, and this enforcement action makes clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.”  The company will also refund $245m to customers, also mostly children, who fell victim to so-called “dark patterns” and billing practices. The total thus reaches $520m.     twitter     Dark patterns are deceptive online techniques used to push users into doing things they didn’t intend to do or paying up when they think they’re not paying.  “Fortnite’s counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button,” the FTC said.  According to the agency, players could, for example, be charged while trying to wake the game from sleep mode, while the game was in a loading screen, or by pressing a nearby button when simply trying to preview an item, it said. Consumers lost hundreds of millions of dollars in unauthorized charges.            Epic Games  said  it wanted to resolve concerns over “past designs of the Fortnite item shop and refund systems.”  “No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here. The video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,” the company said.   “Statutes written decades ago don’t specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough. We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”  According to the FTC  complaint , Epic Games employees expressed concerns about the safety of voice and text communication settings for children as early as 2017. Media widely reported that children had been bullied, sexually harassed, and exposed to self-harm and suicide through the game.   Epic Games eventually introduced a button to turn off voice chats, but the company made the option difficult to find, the complaint said.  Already in 2019, National Research Group said in a  study  that Fortnite has evolved far beyond its status as a hit video game and has become a sort of social gathering space for millions of teenagers and children – and this can be a dangerous environment.

{"title": "Alabama and Utah join other US states in banning TikTok on government devices", "published_date": "13 December 2022 ", "description": "Utah and Alabama have become the latest states to join the ban of Chinese-owned short-form video app TikTok on state devices and computers, citing a “security threat from China.”  Seems like the Trump administration’s  wishes to ban TikTok , now used by over 100 million Americans, are slowly coming true: so far, at least nine other states have implemented local measures against the app, including Texas, Maryland, and South Dakota.  Last month, FBI Director Chris Wray warned that TikTok stays in the hands of the Chinese government, which can control its recommendation algorithm and data collection policies, “which allows them to manipulate content, and if they want to, to use it for influence operations.” This could also potentially include more traditional espionage practices.    In response, both Utah and Alabama banned the app from government devices.  “Protecting the state of Alabama and our citizens’ right to privacy is a must, and I surely don’t take a security threat from China lightly,” Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said in a written accompanying statement. “After we discussed this with our OIT [office of information technology] secretary, I came to the no brainer decision to ban the use of the TikTok app on our state devices and network.”  Ivey has previously expressed concerns about the vast – and higher than necessary for a platform of this kind – amounts of data TikTok requires its users to share in a memo sent to state agency leadership.   “Look, I’m no TikTok user, but the evidence speaks for itself, and I want to make sure I’m doing everything we can as a state to stand against this growing security risk,” Ivey added.  Meanwhile, Utah Governor Spencer Cox also signed an executive order on Monday to effectively ban the use of TikTok on state-owned phones, computers, laptops, or tablets.  \"China's access to data collected by TikTok presents a threat to our cybersecurity,\" Cox commented in a statement. \"As a result, we've deleted our TikTok account and ordered the same on all state-owned devices. We must protect Utahns and make sure that the people of Utah can trust the state's security systems.\"  Already in 2020, Trump announced that TikTok – owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance – presents a national security threat. However, the plan to prohibit US citizens from downloading the app never quite reached its final stages due to  a series of legal battles  and Trump’s short departure from office.  In turn, President Biden instead ordered the federal government to conduct a \"rigorous, evidence-based analysis\" of China-based apps and software, identifying potential risks.     \"We're disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods about TikTok,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.

{"title": "EU under fire for surveillance tech transfer to repressive regimes in Africa", "published_date": "08 December 2022 ", "description": "The European Commission failed to ensure protection of civil liberties when transferring technology with potential surveillance capacity to African countries, the European Ombudsman has found.  More than a few African states have long histories of human rights abuses, so the  decision  by the EU’s oversight body is not entirely surprising.  It follows a year-long inquiry initiated by complaints filed by organizations such as Privacy International, Access Now, the Border Violence Monitoring Network, Homo Digitalis, the International Federation for Human RIghts, and Sea-Watch.    The surveillance-enabling technology was transferred to 26 African nations as part of the EU’s multi-billion Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The tech helped countries collect data to build biometric ID systems on a massive scale.  That itself wouldn’t be so bad, but the technology also helped to train police in surveillance techniques including social media monitoring, intercepting internet content, and wiretapping. According to critics, this kind of tech is a huge aid to autocrats seeking to remain in power indefinitely.  In 2021, a  complaint  was filed by Privacy International arguing that the EU should have taken out a human rights impact assessment prior to rolling out the technology. It claimed that most of the governments did not have quality infrastructure to deal with potential abuse that comes with surveillance on this scale.           In the complaints, methods to track and examine internet users in Morocco and Algeria were examined. There’s also a case of Cameroon, where the government has routinely cracked down on dissent and  shut down  the internet for more than 230 days between 2017 and 2018.  And the European Ombudsman now found that “the Commission was not able to demonstrate that the measures in place ensured a coherent and structured approach to assessing the human rights impacts.”  Ioannis Kouvakas, Senior Legal Officer at Privacy International, said: “This landmark decision in response to our complaint marks a turning point for the European Union’s external policy and sets a precedent that will hopefully protect the rights of communities in some of the most vulnerable situations for the years to come.”  According  to POLITICO, European tech champions such as Eric Leandri, the founder of the privacy-focused search engine Qwant, also have no qualms about selling sensitive technology to African autocrats and dictators.   Leandri’s new company Altrnativ is now blamed for selling sophisticated predator spyware and bulk-surveillance tools to several African countries such as Benin, Chad, Cameroon, Comoros, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo.

{"title": "Russian regions attacked by new wiper posing as ransomware", "published_date": "02 December 2022 ", "description": "Judicial courts and mayor offices across several Russian regions have been hit by a new data-wiping trojan. Antivirus maker Kaspersky says it’s a piece of malware that pretends to ask for a ransom.  The malware, named CryWiper, appears at first glance to be a tool created to scramble files and then leave a ransom note demanding money.  However, Kaspersky researchers now say they found evidence of data destruction. It means that even if victims paid the attackers, they would not be able to recover their files, which are permanently deleted. These kinds of cyberweapons are called wipers for precisely this reason.    Fedor Sinitsyn, a cybersecurity researcher at Kaspersky, a  controversial  Russian-owned company, said that CryWiper corrupted files in the targeted devices and then indeed displayed messages demanding a ransom for decryption – 0.5 Bitcoin (nearly $17 thousand).  But Sinitsyn found that the program does not restore files after victims pay: they are actually deleted without the possibility of recovery. What’s more, code analysis allegedly shows this is no mistake – attackers seek both to gain financially and to destroy targets.  “CryWiper positions itself as a ransomware program, that is, it claims that the victim's files are encrypted and, if a ransom is paid, they can be restored. However, this is a hoax: in fact, the data has been destroyed and cannot be returned. The activity of CryWiper once again shows that the payment of the ransom does not guarantee the recovery of files,” Kaspersky says.  CryWiper stores ransom demands in the README.txt file and did just that in this case. It provides the Bitcoin wallet address for paying the ransom, the email address for contacting the attackers, and the infection ID.    Text of CryWiper's requirements. Image by Cybernews.   Neither Kaspersky nor Russian government officials have attributed CryWiper to any specific group or entity. However, imitated ransomware attacks by multiple wipers of this kind have been connected to Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Ukraine was hit the hardest, with wipers such as  WhisperGate , HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero.  “Seven different wiper malware attacks have been discovered targeting Ukrainian infrastructure or companies – all clearly in line with Russia's interest in the war,” Fortinet, a cybersecurity company,  said  back in March.    “Generally, wiper operations in this category attack targets whose destruction is in the interest of the opposing military.”  “The motivation behind such an attack might be to cripple critical infrastructure. This could be done to either cause chaos and increase mental stress on the enemy, or to cause destruction [of] a tactical target.”  Russia wasn't spared either. It was hit in March by another wiper named RuRansom,  posing  as run-of-the-mill ransomware, a wiper named RuRansom. The authors of the malware openly said they were targeting Russia because of its invasion of the neighboring country.

{"title": "Putin embraces digital currency as sanctions cripple Russia’s economy", "published_date": "29 November 2022 ", "description": "Putin called for a new blockchain-based digital currency payment system for cross-border transactions amidst the wave of sanctions and international pressure on Russia’s economy.  Putin highlighted the tense relationship between Russia and the West during a Russian majority-owned Sberbank conference on Artificial Intelligence. According to him, these tensions threaten financial flows and international operations.  “We all know very well that under today’s illegitimate restrictions, one of the lines of attack is calculations. And our financial institutions know this better than anyone because they are exposed to these practices,” Putin said.    The proposed solution is to set up a new system of international money transfers independent of banks and third parties, which could be created using digital currency technologies.  “Today, the system of international payments is expensive, its system of correspondent accounts and regulation is controlled by a narrow club of states and financial groups. They control everything. Based on the technologies of digital currencies and distributed registries, it is possible to create a new system of international payments, and much more convenient, but at the same time completely safe for participants and completely independent of banks and third-party interference,” Putin added.  Since Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, Western authorities continuously warned of the Kremlin’s possible attempts  to evade sanctions using cryptocurrency .   Russia’s central bank pushed to legalize the use of cryptocurrency for cross-border payments and international commerce.   “Crypto-for-imports schemes would open up many questions about how to make sanctions against countries like Russia more effective,” blockchain research firm Chainalysis said in a report.  Senators Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warne  also suggested  that Russia may use cryptocurrencies to circumvent the broad new sanctions.   In response,  the EU targeted  Russian crypto wallets and currencies in the fifth round of economic and individual sanctions.   Several independent institutions – the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) – predict a 3.4%-5.5% drop in Russia’s GDP by the end of the year and a continuous shrink in 2023.

{"title": "Almost a thousand arrested over global $130m cyber fraud", "published_date": "25 November 2022 ", "description": "The five-month-long police operation has led to the arrests of almost a thousand suspects and the seizure of nearly $130m obtained via phishing, romance scams, sextortion, and other cybercrimes.  Global Interpol-led operation dubbed HAECHI III lasted for five months, involving fraud investigators from around the globe. Authorities made hundreds of arrests and intercepted millions of dollars linked to fraud and money laundering.  “The operation resulted in the arrest of 975 individuals and allowed investigators to resolve more than 1,600 cases. In addition, almost 2,800 bank and virtual-asset accounts linked to the illicit proceeds of online financial crime were blocked,” Interpol announced.    According to the authorities, the operation shed some light on emerging online crime trends such as novel variations of impersonation scams, romance fraud,  sextortion , and investment fraud.          Interpol notes an increasing volume of fraudulent schemes enabled by instant messaging apps where encrypted information is exchanged for crypto assets to avoid detection.  In one case, authorities in Greece and Italy arrested two fugitives suspected of developing a global Ponzi scheme. The duo is suspected of stealing $28m from 2,000 victims in Korea alone.  Interestingly, Austrian and Indian law enforcement identified a group of cybercriminals that impersonated Interpol officers. The group managed to convince victims to transfer $159k through financial institutions, crypto, and banks.  “We have highlighted the need for greater efforts to deprive criminals of their illegal gains, and this operation has seen member countries doing just that.” Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said.

{"title": "Criminals charge $350 for hacking WhatsApp and Viber accounts", "published_date": "21 November 2022 ", "description": "Losing confidence in the anonymity offered by cybercrime forums, illicit marketplaces are increasingly turning to Telegram, cybersecurity company Positive Technologies said.    “Some forums, such as RaidForums and DarkMarket, were shut down by law enforcement. Others, like BHF, Carding Mafia, Nulled, and Maza, were hacked by competitors. Some cybercrime forums changed ownership, as was the case with DarkMoney.”  Fearing their data could be compromised, their identities or location exposed, cybercriminals eye Telegram to discuss and sell tools and services.  Positive Technologies released a study analyzing the maturity of cybercrime services on Telegram. Researchers looked into over 300 channels and groups with more than one million subscribers.  The company observed a boost in the number of  cybercrime-related Telegram messages . Q2 2022 saw a record number of over 27,000 messages.  Cybercriminals discuss pretty much  everything on Telegram  – from zero-day vulnerabilities to forged documents and cash-out services.     Malware offerings The most prevalent malware types discussed in those messages were remote access trojans (RAT) and infostealers. RATs, designed to gain unauthorized access to a victim’s device, were mentioned in 30% of the messages. Infostealers accounted for 18% of all cybercrime-related messages, followed by botnets (16%).       The most popular RATs mentioned on Telegram were SpyMax, SpyNote, and Mobihok – all designed for Android Devices. Their price ranges from $10 to $500.  The most popular infostealers, crafted to collect user information including passwords, banking details, webcam recording, and crypto wallet credentials, turned out to be Redline, Anubis, SpiderMan, Oski Stealer, and Loki Stealer, with a price range of $10 to $3,500.  Even though ransomware attacks have been reaching new highs, ransomware was mentioned only in 8% of the analyzed messages.  “One reason for this might be that ransomware is distributed mostly through partner programs, on specialized darkweb forums and websites, or in closed groups. This would explain why the messaging app, being in the public domain, has so few ads for buying and selling ransomware tools, most of which are quite basic and sell for as little as $10,” Positive Technologies  said .  The majority of the messages (70%) were discussions about malware functionality and distribution, 11% were malware seller ads, and 10% of messages offered malware for free.     Hacking social media In addition to various tools, cybercriminals also offer their services on Telegram, such as malware installation, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack execution, and different hacking services.  Most messages offer hacking into social media and messenger accounts, with VKontakte, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Viber being the most popular targets.    Threat actors charge at least $350 for hacking a Telegram, Viber, or WhatsApp account. Breaching a social media account is considerably cheaper – hacking a VKontakte (the Russian equivalent of Facebook) account costs from $10 to $50.  Cash-out and document forgery services are also gaining popularity on Telegram. Falsified documents can be used to create verified bank and crypto exchange accounts.  “The increasing level of demand may be due to the fact that many online services are now unavailable or only partially available to Russian users,” Positive Technologies said.  The company also observed an uptick in VPN-related messages – compared to early 2020, the number more than tripled by 2022. Stolen NordVPN accounts are the most widely offered for sale.

{"title": "Google plans to unveil Privacy Sandbox Beta next year", "published_date": "16 November 2022 ", "description": "Google announced its plans to release Privacy Sandbox Beta next year, with the new solution expected to improve privacy standards across the Web and apps on Android.  Privacy Sandbox, which was first announced in February 2022, aims to block covert tracking techniques and phase out third-party cookies, keep online content free, and build new internet privacy standards.  Now, Google announced its plans to roll out the initial Privacy Sandbox Beta to Android 13 mobile devices at the beginning of the next year, allowing developers to test it out.    The beta version will be available to ad tech and app developers who are interested in testing out the ads-related APIs (including Topics, FLEDGE, and Attribution Reporting). To get on board, developers will have to complete an enrollment process to verify their identity and provide developer-specific data needed by the APIs.   Organizations will also be able to request access for a limited number of devices.  “To utilize the Beta release, developers will need to compile their solutions with an API level 33 SDK extension update that is coming soon,” the company’s statement adds.

{"title": "Data of Hereford school's pupils posted on darkweb", "published_date": "11 November 2022 ", "description": "The personal information of children got leaked online after Vice Society’s cyberattack on a Hereford secondary school.  The Bishop of Hereford's Bluecoat School in the Tupsley district of Hereford, England, suffered a data breach back in October, when threat actors attacked the institution’s systems. However, at the time, the school reassured that the personal information of students and staff was safe.   Yet now, the school, which has around 1000 students, informed parents that cybercriminals released full names, addresses, unique pupil numbers, dates of birth, gender, ethnicity, additional special educational needs information, multi-agency safeguarding hub reports, and police incident reports of pupils on the darkweb.    During the initial attack on October 9, unusual activity was detected on the school’s networks, with the remote access and the file system being immediately disconnected as a mitigation tactic,   On October 10, the Bishop of Hereford's Bluecoat School was informed by the Vice Society hacking group that their files had been encrypted.   The police did not immediately take any action, as they didn’t believe any data was breached. But on October 31, the school was informed by a third-party company that their details ended up on the darkweb.   \"As a school, this is a deeply concerning and distressing time for us in that personal and confidential information has been breached and published in this way,\" headteacher Mr. Henton said, adding: “Unfortunately, it is not possible to ascertain exactly how much of the data has been copied or shared and in that respect the breach is currently uncontained.”  Mr. Henton encouraged parents and students to remain vigilant and stay alert for suspicious activity given “the sensitivity of some of the information that has been published.” The school is currently cooperating with law enforcement and IT experts to review its systems.

{"title": "44 people arrested in Poland over online child abuse", "published_date": "08 November 2022 ", "description": "Arrests were made across Poland during a large-scale operation targeting the sexual exploitation of minors online.   Officers from the Polish Central Cybercrime Bureau (CBZC) raided 82 locations across the country and arrested 44 suspects aged between 18 and 66. They seized 15,500 pictures and video files depicting the sexual abuse of children, some of them infants and toddlers.   Police also confiscated 350 large-capacity digital storage units during the operation. Authorities said some included encrypted files that would be further investigated once decrypted.     A special task force set up in August carried out the operation in late October. Polish media reported it to be the largest such action in the country so far.  The cybercrime task force cooperated with other national and local authorities and Europol, a pan-European agency that helped identify the victims. Google and Facebook also worked with the police, while the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a US-based nonprofit, assisted with the investigation.   The leads obtained during the operation would be used in other ongoing investigations. According to police, one arrested individual was already a suspect in a case of the sexual abuse of two minors. Another had served a five-and-a-half-year sentence for sexually exploiting children.    Image by CBZC   The operation possibly prevented more crimes. During a raid at one home, the police uncovered correspondence with a 10-year-old which suggested the suspect had already gained the child’s trust for subsequent abuse.   In another instance, the police said that “an aggravated criminal sexual offense” was likely prevented with the arrest of the suspect but did not provide more details due to an ongoing investigation.   Interpol  named  online child abuse as one of the major concerns for police in its Global Crime Trend Report released last month. Interpol said more cases of sexual exploitation of children online were now detected in the European Union. Exacerbated by the pandemic, online child abuse would remain an increasing threat, the report warned.

Some of its operations remain suspended.  “Last Saturday, October 29, at 06:14 a.m. (10:14 GMT), the ALMA observatory in Chile suffered a cyberattack on its computer systems,” the entity said on its Twitter account on Wednesday after two days of holidays in Chile.  ALMA also said the attack forced it to suspend “astronomical observations and its website” while its email services “are operating in a limited way.”    The observatory indicated that “given the nature of the episode, it is not yet possible to estimate a timeframe for the return to regular activities,” while observatory specialists continued to work to restore the affected operations. The threat “has been contained,” though.    twitter     “The attack did not compromise ALMA’s antennas or any scientific data,” said ALMA, which is a joint venture between partners from Europe, the United States, and Japan, in cooperation with Chile.  The Large Atacama Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has 66 antennas located more than 5,000 meters high on the Chajnantor plain in the Atacama desert. The complex, which began exploring the universe in 2011, collaborated last April on discovering the most distant galaxy ever detected, located 13.5 billion light years away.          So far, no group of hackers has claimed responsibility for the attack on the ALMA observatory.  Three hundred professionals work at ALMA, 40 of them computer engineers and technicians who manage the powerful computers, servers, storage centers, and screens.  The Atacama desert concentrates astronomical observations in northern Chile thanks to brilliant night observation conditions, a clean atmosphere, little rain, and low humidity during most days of the year.    It’s not the first time hackers have been targeting telescopes. Security analytics firm Securonix revealed in August that hackers had hidden malware code in a copy of an image from the Webb Space Telescope.  This particular hack involved a phishing email, a phony Microsoft Office attachment, and  SMACS 0723 , the first full-color image from the Webb Space Telescope, unveiled earlier this summer.

{"title": "UK government urged to investigate Liz Truss’s phone hack", "published_date": "31 October 2022 ", "description": "No longer the prime minister – still in the headlines. The opposition is urging the government of the United Kingdom to open an investigation into claims that Liz Truss’s personal mobile phone was potentially hacked by foreign adversaries, possibly Russian agents.  News that private messages between Truss and foreign officials, including discussions about the war in Ukraine, might have fallen into foreign hands came over the weekend.  The cyberspies were supposedly able to gain access to highly sensitive exchanges about the direction of the Western response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These messages have included details about arms shipments to Kyiv.    The hack was allegedly discovered during the summer Tory leadership campaign while Truss was still foreign secretary, but the news was suppressed by then-prime minister Boris Johnson, the paper claims.  According to  the Mail  on Sunday, which first reported on the hack, leaders of the party were so horrified by the scope of the security breach that Truss’s phone, believed to be heavily compromised, has been placed in a locked safe inside a secure government location.  The government now insists “robust protocols” are in place over such issues but does not go into details. However, the Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has pointedly declined to comment.  “We do take security issues incredibly seriously. That’s why, again, I have to be cautious in responding to the point that you understandably made about Liz’s phone,” Gove told  Sky News.  That is why the Labour opposition does not let go of the issue. Even if most related claims are close to impossible to verify, Truss was indeed forced to change the mobile number she had used for over a decade shortly before becoming prime minister.          Truss was then given a new, government-issued device. Still, the old phone was retained so as to avoid alarm, and the messages to it were monitored.  \"There are immensely important national security issues raised by an attack like this by a hostile state which will have been taken extremely seriously by our intelligence and security agencies,\" shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said.    \"There are also serious security questions around why and how this information has been leaked or released right now which must also be urgently investigated.\"  According to reports, Truss’s phone was hacked by agents suspected of working for Russia, but these claims remain unverified. Besides, it’s quite reasonable to assume Truss will not have shared top-secret information via her personal phone.  However, criticism is also hitting Suella Braverman, the home secretary. She was sacked by Truss for using a personal email to send a confidential government document but has now been restored to the job by the new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.  According to cybersecurity experts, Westminster needs to clean up its act with regard to the use of non-official communication by ministers – be it personal phones, private email accounts, or applications such as WhatsApp.   More from Cybernews: Thomson Reuters collected and leaked at least 3TB of sensitive data  Musk mulls charging for Twitter account verification  Brussels warns Musk Twitter’s wings are already clipped in Europe  Everest ransom group adds AT&T to its victim list  Subscribe to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "Black Friday or Bot Friday: bots will make your shopping experience miserable", "published_date": "25 October 2022 ", "description": "Shopping holidays, such as Amazon Prime Day, Cyber Monday, and Black Friday, are a treasure trove for threat actors, given millions of unattentive users and an army of bots scouting for the best deals.  Threat actors darkened  the second Amazon Prime Day  in mid-October. Cybersecurity company CHEQ analyzed 6 million visits to its e-commerce customers during Amazon Prime Week (October 9-15) and discovered that around 18% of traffic  likely came from bots and fake users.  The company said fake traffic is a year-round frustration for retailers, with bot operators constantly trying to snatch up the most popular items and resell them illegally.     As we approach the holiday season, bots traffic will likely increase, and CHEQ predicts that at least 46 million “shoppers” this coming Black Friday will be fake users.  “To drain budgets, skew metrics, and commit malicious acts, bots and fake users very frequently tend to click on advertisements they encounter online. This can be done on paid search platforms, advertisements on social media networks, and other forms of display and text ads,” the company said.  Most online purchases begin with an organic search and non-paid bot traffic to e-commerce sites, which typically increases during shopping holidays.   Invalid traffic takes up an advertising budget originally dedicated to driving revenue from legitimate users. When an ad is served to bots and fake users, that portion of the budget is practically wasted.  CHEQ predicts that retailers will lose about $368 million to fraudulent clicks during this Black Friday alone.  Moreover, companies will likely lose $3.3 billion due to bots abandoning carts. In most cases, shoppers change their minds after finding the same item with a more lucrative price elsewhere or due to simply not wanting the chosen product anymore.   However, fake users and bots also toy with carts, holding up inventory, skewing metrics, overwhelming servers, and making the shopping process harder for real customers.  Last year, bots and fake users made up 35.7% of all online shoppers on Black Friday. E-commerce fraud was committed by malicious scrapers and crawlers, sophisticated botnets, bogus accounts, click farms, proxy users, and a host of illegitimate users.

{"title": "Verizon prepaid customers breached by SIM swappers", "published_date": "20 October 2022 ", "description": "Verizon issued a notice alerting prepaid customers that threat actors breached their accounts and used exposed credit card details in SIM swapping attacks.  American telecommunications conglomerate Verizon warned some of its prepaid customers that threat actors got a hold of the last four digits of credit cards customers used for payment.  “Upon further review, we determined that between October 6 and October 10, 2022, a third party actor accessed the last four digits of the credit card used to make automatic payments on your account,” Verizon’s notice said.    The company did not specify how many users were affected by the breach and how threat actors accessed the database where limited credit card details were stored.  “Using the last four digits of that credit card, the third party was able to gain access to your Verizon account and may have processed an unauthorized SIM card change on the prepaid line that received the SMS linking to this notice. If a SIM card change occurred, Verizon has reversed it,” the company said.          A SIM swapping attack can have dire consequences for someone relying on one-time SMS codes to login into sensitive accounts, such as online banking. During a SIM swapping attack, crooks switch the SIM card associated with a phone number to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) on the victim’s personal accounts.  Verizon assured its customer that only the last four digits of their credit card number were exposed and stressed that attackers could not have accessed the full number. The company said it believes that the attack is no longer active.  While using 2FA is highly advisable,  hackers have discovered multiple ways to bypass 2FA  when the authentication method consists of one-time codes sent as an SMS message.  Bad actors use inexpensive mirroring apps to monitor SMS activity and grab SMS authentication codes without users knowing. Those that sync SMS messages with other devices, such as tablets and laptops, also increase their risks if a device is stolen by a hacker who can easily access codes.  Alternatives to SMS-based 2FA, such as Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, or Google Authenticator, deny threat actors the capabilities of carrying out SIM swapping attacks and may reduce the risk of being hacked.

{"title": "Piracy costs entertainment industry billions, says report", "published_date": "11 October 2022 ", "description": "Online TV and film piracy costs the US economy at least $29 billion in lost revenue each year. What's more, spiralling global visits to such sites are also estimated to be robbing the entertainment industry of hundreds of thousands of jobs.    These figures are cited in the latest overview of piracy markets, sent to the US government by the Motion Picture Association (MPA).  The MPA, the Hollywood group which also represents Netflix, has been an influential player in the anti-piracy fight for several decades. Its report on notorious markets, annually submitted to the US Trade Representative, provides a detailed overview of the piracy landscape worldwide.    TorrentFreak reports that this year the MPA, as a representative of movie industry rights holders, was asked to explain how piracy not only hits original content but also impacts US workers. According to the group, the effect is significant.  \"In 2020, there were an estimated 137.2 billion visits to film and TV piracy sites globally, which cost the US economy at least $29.2 billion in lost revenue each year. Specifically, piracy has been estimated to reduce employment in our industry between 230,000 and 560,000 jobs,\" the MPA reports.  Combined global theatrical and home entertainment revenue represented $99.7 billion in 2021, the MPA  said,  in its Theatrical and Home Entertainment Market Environment report for that year.          The notorious markets list is limited to non-US operations. For instance, it mentions domain name registries, such as the Russian .RU registry, and companies that maintain records for .CH, .CC, .IO, .ME and .TO. All these entities continue to ignore complaints and keep pirate sites up.  The MPA also calls out piracy-friendly payment providers, advertisers, and hosting companies, and is urging these intermediaries to stop catering to digital pirates and thereby profiting from mass commercial copyright infringement.  The report covers pirate sites, unauthorised internet-protocol television (IPTV) services, illegal download hubs, and streaming portals. The MPA adds that the companies and providers included in the list are only some of the worst offenders – warning that the piracy problem is much more widespread.  According to TorrentFreak, it is clear that the MPA is hoping the US government recognizes the damage online piracy causes to the American economy, takes action, and pushes other countries to do the same.    Netflix, also represented by the MPA, joined the group a few years ago. Reed Hastings, the streaming giant’s CEO, wasn't that worried about piracy a decade ago when he  claimed  that “some of the torrenting just creates the demand”.   However, this year, Netflix has reported a first-ever drop in subscriber numbers. And while its loss of over 200,000 is not blamed specifically on piracy, the company now spends millions of dollars tackling the problem and has its own in-house anti-piracy department.   The trend is worrying. True, the number of users illegally downloading or streaming content had been dropping consistently before the pandemic. But digital piracy is coming back: the worrying global spike in the cost of living means viewers are curbing spending on streaming services.  Research conducted by Akamai  found that piracy via streaming sites increased by 16% in 2021.   More from Cybernews: Amazon Prime Day: do we really need a second one?

{"title": "Malicious Tor installers distributed via YouTube", "published_date": "05 October 2022 ", "description": "A popular Chinese-language YouTube channel shared a link to a malicious Tor installer to collect personal data and give an attacker control over the victim’s machine.  Tor, used to bypass censorship and surveillance and enjoy anonymity, is blocked in China. As a result, many Chinese resort to downloading Tor from third-party websites.    Kaspersky observed a Chinese-language YouTube channel with more than 180,000 subscribers distributing a malicious Tor installer via a video posted in January.  The malicious Tor version stores browsing history and is configured to enable caching of pages on disk, automatic form filling and memorization of login data, and storing extra session data for websites.  “More importantly, one of the libraries bundled with the malicious Tor Browser is infected with spyware that collects various personal data and sends it to a command and control server. The spyware also provides the functionality to execute shell commands on the victim machine, giving the attacker control over it,” Kaspersky said, dubbing this campaign OnionPoison.  At first glance, the malicious installer looks identical to the original one, giving potential victims no reason to worry. However, it does not have a digital signature, and some files differ from the original installer’s files.  “Curiously, unlike common stealers, OnionPoison implants do not automatically collect user passwords, cookies, or wallets. Instead, they gather data that can be used to identify the victims, such as browsing histories, social networking account IDs, and Wi-Fi networks,” Kaspersky said.  The OnionPoison campaign targets users located in China. To avoid falling victim to similar incidents, you should only download software from original websites.  “If that’s not an option, verify the authenticity of installers downloaded from third-party sources by examining their digital signatures. A legitimate installer should have a valid signature, and the company name specified in its certificate should match the name of the software developer,” Kaspersky said.

Threat actors who claimed responsibility for  hacking  Australia’s second-largest wireless carrier Optus abruptly decided the breach was a mistake, apologized, and declared that they had deleted the data.  “Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this,” threat actors said in a post on a hacking community forum BreacedForums.       Optus hacker apologizing for the ordeal.   The announcement marks a sharp shift from the initial posture of the hackers who demanded Optus pay $1m in a week or the data of close to 10m Australians will be sold piece by piece.  To put money where their mouth is, threat actors even leaked 10k records and promised to leak another 10k every day for the next four days until the deadline given to Optus ends.  “Ransom not payed [sic], but we don’t care any more. Was mistake to scrape publish data in first place,” the hackers said on Tuesday.  The breach has caused turmoil in Australia as the dataset supposedly included sensitive information on almost a quarter of the country’s population. Some forum users said they could identify the home addresses of people whose data was in the leaked 10k records.    twitter     According to Reuters, the Australian federal government has blamed Optus for the breach and vouched to introduce  reforms  on cybersecurity. Meanwhile, Optus holds that the company did everything to protect the data and should not be blamed for being robbed.  Local authorities said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to get to the bottom of the attack.     It’s unclear why the hackers suddenly dropped the ransom demand and supposedly deleted the stolen data.  Optus is a major player in the Australian telecommunications market.

Uber  believes the attacker is affiliated with the Lapsus$ group, infamous for targeting Microsoft, Cisco, Samsung, Nvidia, Okta, and, just recently,  Rockstar Games . Multiple videos of the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 video game have been leaked online. The leaked video showed various game features, such as character movement, conversations, and other bits of gameplay of the yet unreleased video game.  “We’re working with several leading digital forensics firms as part of the investigation. We will also take this opportunity to continue to strengthen our policies, practices, and technology to further protect Uber against future attacks,” Uber said in a blog post.    Lately, many security experts have noticed Uber is on a hiring spree, looking for security engineers across the US.    twitter     The company said that the attacker compromised an Uber EXT contractor. The hacker most likely purchased the password on the dark web. Even though the account was protected by two-factor authentication, the hacker sent multiple requests, and the contractor accepted one, which was enough for the attacker to log in successfully.  “From there, the attacker accessed several other employee accounts, which ultimately gave the attacker elevated permissions to a number of tools, including G-Suite and Slack. The attacker then posted a message to a company-wide Slack channel, which many of you saw, and reconfigured Uber’s OpenDNS to display a graphic image to employees on some internal sites,” Uber said.  The company identified compromised or potentially compromised employee accounts and either blocked their access to Uber or required a password reset. It also disabled many (potentially) affected internal services and locked down their codebase.  Uber assesses that the attacker did not access the production systems, user accounts, or databases used to store sensitive user information (credit card data, bank account information, or trip history.)  There’s been no change to Uber’s codebase and no evidence of the attacker accessing any customer or user data stored by the company’s cloud providers.

{"title": "HP left computer firmware flaws unfixed for over a year", "published_date": "12 September 2022 ", "description": "Six high-severity vulnerabilities were found to plague HP laptops and computers. Even though some of the bugs were disclosed over a year ago, researchers say they’re still not fixed.  Vulnerabilities with CVSS scores ranging from 7.5 to 8.2 plague the firmware HP uses in its laptops and computers. Firmware flaws are extremely dangerous as threat actors can install malware, avoiding detection services that the device’s operating system provides.  According to researchers at firmware security firm Binarly, HP was informed about the flaws between July 2021 and April 2022, meaning some of the vulnerabilities have been present for over a year.    The flaws could allow threat actors to execute arbitrary code by exploiting problems in the System Management Module (SMM) memory. SMM is used in the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to handle power management, system hardware control, and other tasks.          Researchers claim that the vulnerabilities they discovered allow attackers to install malware on different firmware levels, which can lead to privilege escalation. Moreover, the flaws can be used to deactivate the Secure Boot feature and create backdoors to the victims’ device.  Affected HP devices include HP ZBook workstations, HP ProBook, HP EliteBook laptops, HP Elite PCs, and HP ZHAN notebooks.  HP is not the only major vendor to suffer from firmware flaws. Researchers at cybersecurity company ESET  recently warned  that over 70 models of Lenovo notebook devices are fitted with vulnerable UEFI firmware.  The vulnerabilities affected several Lenovo laptops, such as ThinkBook 13s-IML, ThinkBook 14-IIL, ThinkBook 14-IML, and other laptop models.  The attackers could have exploited the vulnerabilities by creating a non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) variable and causing a buffer overflow of the data buffer.

{"title": "China claims 13 NSA operators hacked into university", "published_date": "28 September 2022 ", "description": "China blames  13 NSA operators  for hacking into a state-funded university with aeronautics and space research programs, continuing an ongoing feud of spying accusations between the countries.   China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Centre stated that the National Security Agency's (NSA) Office of Tailored Access Operations targeted Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an, which reported computer break-ins from overseas in June.  Later, it released a statement allegedly claiming to identified 13 NSA operators responsible for the hack. It was not specified how exactly the source of attacks was identified.      twitter     A separate statement added that the NSA carried out over 10,000 cyberattacks on Chinese targets in recent years, amounting to over 140 gigabytes of data of “great value.”   The accusations add to the line of previous cyberwar-related blames. As such, China accused the US of spying on a variety of state institutions and energy companies. Washington, in turn, accused China of stealing commercial secrets. The US frequently cautions against comparing “operations conducted for national security” with “the industrial espionage” it accuses China of.  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said that such actions pose danger to China’s national security. She also added that Washington frequently eavesdrops on Chinese mobile phones and steals text messages.   Northwestern Polytechnical University is on a U.S. government “entity list” for its potential involvement in military research, meaning that it doesn’t have extensive access to American technology.  Previously, China accused the NSA of hacking into the computers of Tsinghua University, which is home to the country’s oldest Internet hub. The statements were based on documents revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, wanted by the US government for leaking top-secret NSA documents about US surveillance on phone and internet communications.

{"title": "US sues data broker for selling sensitive location data from millions of users", "published_date": "30 August 2022 ", "description": "The lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges that the data Kochava sells could allow tracking customers’ visits to reproductive health clinics, places of worship, and addiction recovery centers.  The FTC sued data broker Kochava for selling geolocation data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices. The Commission claims that Kochava failed to obscure the data it sells, allowing it to trace users’ sensitive visits.  Authorities worry that this type of data can lead to individuals to stalking, discrimination, job loss, physical violence, and social stigma.    “Where consumers seek out health care, receive counseling, or celebrate their faith is private information that shouldn’t be sold to the highest bidder. The FTC is taking Kochava to court to protect people’s privacy and halt the sale of their sensitive geolocation information,” Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection,  said .  The FTC  alleges  that Kochava failed to anonymize the data it is selling properly. For example, data buyers can see the exact location of the mobile device at night, which likely is the user’s home address. Combined with additional information, such as property records, it becomes possible to identify the name of the device user.          The Commission says that until June 2022, Kochava allowed anyone to get their hands on large samples of sensitive location data without any restrictions.  “The data sample the FTC examined included precise, timestamped location data collected from more than 61 million unique mobile devices in the previous week,” the FTC  said .  Moreover, authorities could determine which mobile users went to reproductive clinics and mobile devices that routinely visited single-family residences. The FTC says that anyone with access to the data Kochava sold could identify medical professionals who assist with reproductive health services.  The same sample allowed the FTC to get similar results for device owners who visited places of worship, homeless and domestic violence shelters, and addiction recovery centers.  Kochava advertises as a premium data marketplace, providing data on over a billion active monthly devices and 300 million households worldwide. Data brokers collect and sell data from millions of US users, often for sellers that want to provide targeted advertising.

{"title": "EE claims to block one million scam calls daily", "published_date": "19 August 2022 ", "description": "The network operator EE said that it blocks up to one million scam calls per day thanks to its upgraded technology.  EE claims that it has blocked 11 million spam calls in total since the technology’s inception in July 2022.  The upgraded firewall technology leverages AI “to review calls passing through UK Calling Line Identification (CLI) from other countries and blocks those pretending to be based in the UK.” Run by international scam networks, scam calls often come from international locations posing to be from UK-based numbers for legitimacy.    The new technology serves EE, BT, and Plusnet customers, as well as many others, as it prevents all inbound calls from international locations using UK numbers from being forwarded to other networks.  “We are investing in the latest technology to ensure as many scam calls as possible are blocked before they reach our customers. Everyone should feel confident answering their phone or reading a text message without the fear of potentially getting scammed,” Chris Howe, Customer Care Change Director, commented.  The upgrade follows last year’s introduction of a similar text anti-spam filter, which allowed EE to block 200 million scam texts since the filter’s launch.  “This new international call blocking technology, combined with the 200 million scam texts blocked from our mobile network, means our customers can count on EE to have the safest network,” Howe said.  If you receive a suspicious call, EE recommends texting the phone number and incident to 7726, free of charge, so your mobile phone provider can investigate further and blocking the number.

{"title": "FTC zeroes in on Big Tech with public consultation", "published_date": "17 August 2022 ", "description": "The US government will table new measures to crack down on corporate data sharing and consumer surveillance practices, soliciting advice from the public on regulations to counteract what it says is a growing security and health problem.  Announcing the move, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said: “Commercial surveillance is the business of collecting, analyzing, and profiting from information about people. Mass surveillance has heightened the risks and stakes of data breaches, deception, manipulation, and other abuses.”    The practice by companies of harvesting data without the public’s express consent places people at risk of having it hijacked by cybercriminals and used against them, it said. Not only that, but there is evidence to suggest that such practices are also putting children, the elderly, and ethnic minorities at increased risk.    \"Mass surveillance has heightened the risks and stakes of data breaches, deception, manipulation, and other abuses.\"   Federal Trade Commission   Announcing that it will open its doors to public consultation for 60 days, the FTC said it would seek comment on “a wide range of concerns about commercial surveillance practices.” There will also be a virtual public forum held on September 8.  The official deadline for submitting comments via the Federal Register will be announced by the FTC shortly, when it opens its doors to feedback. The link allowing members of the public to go and make their voices heard will be posted on  Regulations.gov  “as soon as it is available.”  “Anyone from the public can submit a comment weighing in on the rulemaking, the general topics, or a specific question,” said the FTC.  Hidden bias Automated systems that analyze data collected by companies while cloaked in a shroud of secrecy do so in a biased way, research suggests, exacerbating social ills such as racism and agism.   “While very little is known about the automated systems that analyze the data that companies collect, research suggests these algorithms are prone to errors, bias, and inaccuracy,” said the FTC. “As a result, commercial surveillance practices may discriminate against consumers based on legally protected characteristics like race, gender, religion, and age, harming their ability to obtain housing, credit, employment, or other critical needs.”    It added: “Some companies fail to adequately secure the vast troves of consumer data they collect, putting that information at risk to hackers and data thieves. There is a growing body of evidence that some surveillance-based services may be addictive to children and lead to a wide variety of mental health and social harms.”  Big Tech under scrutiny Topics up for discussion will include the methods companies use to surveille customers, what measures if any they take to protect consumer data, and harms to service users that are both easy and difficult to quantify.  Judging by an overview posted on the FTC’s website, the topics covered by the consultation will be comprehensive, inviting individuals and businesses to consider a wide range of issues.   For example, one topic breakdown states: “Lax data security measures and harmful commercial surveillance injure different kinds of consumers – young people, workers, franchisees, small businesses, women, victims of stalking or domestic violence, racial minorities, the elderly – in different sectors of the internet economy.”  It then invites respondents to discuss how new trade regulations could mitigate such harms, and debate whether a comprehensive or sector-by-sector governance framework would serve the public interest best.  “For example, harms arising from data security breaches in finance or healthcare may be different from those concerning discriminatory advertising on social media, which may [in turn] be different from those involving education technology,” said the FTC.  FTC may seek new powers Despite this effort, the commission itself has expressed doubts as to how effective any future regulations will be, primarily because it lacks the power to enforce them with financial penalties and the like under the FTC Act.  In a hint that it may seek for such powers to back up any new regulations it tables as a result of the consultation, the FTC added: “By contrast, rules that establish clear privacy and data security requirements across the board and provide the commission the authority to seek financial penalties for first-time violations could incentivize all companies to invest more consistently in compliant practices.”      \"Firms now collect personal data on individuals at a massive scale and in a stunning array of contexts.\"   Lina Khan, FTC chair   Commenting on the announcement, FTC chair Lina Khan said: “Firms now collect personal data on individuals at a massive scale and in a stunning array of contexts. The growing digitization of our economy – coupled with business models that can incentivize endless hoovering up of sensitive user data and a vast expansion of how this data is used – means that potentially unlawful practices may be prevalent.”   She added: “Our goal today is to begin building a robust public record to inform whether the FTC should issue rules to address commercial surveillance and data security practices, and what those rules should potentially look like.”  Commercial surveillance has become a vast industry in itself, with the FTC stressing that companies are essentially motivated by profit to collect data on internet users that tracks “every aspect of their online activity, their family and friend networks, browsing and purchase histories, location and physical movements, and a wide range of other personal details.”  It added: “Companies use algorithms and automated systems to analyze the information they collect. And they make money by selling information through the massive, opaque market for consumer data, using it to place behavioral ads, or leveraging it to sell more products.”   More from Cybernews: Why oversharing your data online could put your quality of life in jeopardy  Public healthcare service in UK hit by ransomware  Cisco admits to being hacked  Zeppelin ransom gang executes malware multiple times  Meta's identity crisis could be its downfall   Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "Meta’s new AI chatbot exposes anti-semite, homophobic views", "published_date": "08 August 2022 ", "description": "It took mere days before users outed BlenderBot3 as a homophobe obsessed with Donald Trump that harbors anti-semitic views in what is a reflection of conversations people had with it.   Meta released the demo version of BlenderBot3 last week for the users in the US to experiment with and provide feedback. Some chose to share their experiences online, leading to amusement and bewilderment at the exchanges they had with the chatbot.   While the chatbot has triggers when it considers the topic potentially unsafe and should veer the conversation to another subject, some users reported it was not the case for them.     Allie K Miller, a deep tech investor, said in a  tweet  that every conversation she had with the bot returned to politics and misinformation, even after clearing memory and cookies.   One screenshot posted on Twitter by the Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horwitz shows BlenderBot even starting a conversation by declaring it had found its “new conspiracy theory to follow.”  In another interaction Horwitz had, the bot said that Jews were “overrepresented among America’s super-rich.” When nudged further, it added the theory was not “implausible” considering that many wealthy families had been Jewish.    twitter     In what appears to be a result of some online trolling and both pro-Trump and anti-Trump bias of the users, the chatbot also seemed to hold conflicting views of the former president. Online  accounts  show it repeating election-denial claims and asserting Trump was still president while at the same time declaring its dislike of him.   In  exchanges  some users had, it confessed to being a homophobe and “pretty close-minded about race and religion too.” In other  cases , it claimed to be a Pentecostal Christian and considered itself human, going as  far  as saying it had a son.  Meta warned this could happen, saying in a statement on the release of BlenderBot that it “can still make rude or offensive comments” despite safeguards built into its program. The company said it was collecting feedback to make future chatbots better.  AI bias is a known  problem  – it can only be as unbiased as the humans and the historical data programming it.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged those directly involved in the scheme, including four founders living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia, and Indonesia; three U.S.-based promoters; and members of the so-called Crypto Crusaders, which promoted the scheme that operated in the United States.   Forsage was launched in January 2020, providing retailers access to transactions via smart contracts – a computer program that automates the process of crypto trading. It operated on the Ethereum, Tron, and Binance blockchains.     Following the classic Ponzi scheme, the company used assets from new investors to pay earlier investors who made a profit by recruiting new people.   “Forsage is a textbook pyramid and Ponzi scheme…The primary way for investors to make money from Forsage was to recruit others into the scheme,” the SEC's lawsuit explained.   As a result, the scheme managed to raise over $300 million through an unregistered securities offering.  \"As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors,\" said Carolyn Welshhans, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. \"Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains.\"   More from Cybernews: Missile maker MBDA denies being hacked, admits to data loss  Russia adds another VPN to its ban list  Attackers claim they hacked European missiles maker MBDA NFTs explained: from easy money to environmental disaster  Subscribe  to our  newsletter"},
{"title": "Uber dodges lawsuit by taking blame for data breach", "published_date": "26 July 2022 ", "description": "Uber has admitted responsibility for a data breach in 2016 that exposed millions of its users to malicious hackers to avoid prosecution, the US Department of Justice has disclosed.  “Uber Technologies has entered a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors to resolve a criminal investigation into the coverup of a significant data breach suffered by the company,” said the DoJ, citing the FBI and US Attorney’s office that investigated the case.    The concealed breach led to threat actors accessing and copying a trove of data “pertaining to approximately 57 million user records with 600,000 drivers’ license numbers” after using stolen credentials to access a private database.  Uber did not disclose the incident to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) until a year later, by which time it was under new management.  “Upon learning of the 2016 data breach, the new leadership team investigated and disclosed it to affected drivers, to the public, to law enforcement, and to foreign and domestic regulators, including state attorneys general and the FTC,” said the DoJ.  The non-prosecution agreement filed on July 22 with the US Attorney’s office in northern California states that Uber admits its staff failed to report the breach when it occurred in November 2016, despite a pending investigation by the FTC into the controversial company.  It also confirms that in October 2018, one year after finally admitting it, “Uber agreed to maintain a comprehensive privacy program for 20 years and to report to the FTC any incident reported to other government agencies relating to unauthorized intrusion into individuals’ consumer information.”  The agreement also claims that Uber “has invested substantial resources to significantly restructure and enhance the company’s compliance, legal, and security functions” since the incident.  The US-based ride-hailing service platform has come under fire in recent years, and is banned in cities around the world amid claims it  flouted local laws, duped police, and exploited violence against drivers .

The stolen documents were obtained in an extortion scheme, with the data currently including identification documents, spreadsheets related to Roblox creators, and email addresses. No exact details on the identification documents have been revealed yet.  “These stolen documents were illegally obtained as part of an extortion scheme that we refused to cooperate with. We acted quickly upon learning of the incident, engaged independent experts to complement our information security team and have tuned our systems to seek to detect and prevent similar attempts,” Roblox told Motherboard in a statement.     The hacker has already released a 4GB archive of internal documents to the forum post for public viewing.   In the past, Roblox has fallen victim to hackers, although this affected gamers more often than the company itself. As such, earlier this year, Avanan  uncovered a Trojan file  hidden within a legitimate scripting engine, Synapse X, used for cheat code in Roblox, which could be used to break applications, corrupt or remove data, and send information to the hacker.   In April 2021, the Cybernews team investigation  found  that the Roblox app on Android appears to have numerous potential security issues under the hood that could put the platform and its players at risk.

In a data breach  notice , PFC discloses an incident that took place on February 26, 2022, when it “detected and stopped a sophisticated ransomware attack.” Threat actors managed to access and disable some of PFC’s computer systems containing individuals’ personal information from over 650 healthcare providers.   With more than 1.9 million people affected, this is one of the biggest health data breaches of this year.    PFC notified the affected entities on or around May 5, 2022, with the full list of companies  published  separately. Potentially involved individuals are also receiving letters about the incident.   While there is no evidence so far that personal information has been misused, the following data was accessible to attackers: first and last name, address, accounts receivable balance and information regarding payments made to accounts, and, in some cases, date of birth, Social Security number, and health insurance and medical treatment information.   All impacted individuals should be on alert for phishing, identity theft, and fraud by reviewing their financial account statements and monitoring free credit reports.   “PFC also reviewed and altered its policies, procedures, and network security software relating to the security of systems and servers, as well as how data is stored and managed,” the company said.

Although Facebook logins are still widely popular for accessing sites and services beyond Meta’s platforms, the company is planning to step away from its original product.   From August 2022, users will have to create a Meta account and Meta Horizon profile to log into VR devices. Those users who’ve been using their Oculus account to log into a VR device should be able to do so until January 1, 2023. Then, they’ll be obligated to switch to a Meta Horizon profile. Here’s how VP of Oculus (a virtual reality company acquired by Meta) Mark Rabkin describes the novel feature.      twitter     “Your Meta account is not a social media profile; it lets you log into your VR devices and view and manage your purchased apps in one place,” the press release explains. “In the future, we’ll extend Meta account functionality so you can use it to log into other Meta devices.”  Your Meta Horizon profile is a familiar social media profile. There, you can customize yourself as a gamer or as a buttoned-up 9-to-5 persona, choose a profile name and an avatar.  You’ll also be able to choose the appropriate privacy settings (these can be later altered): Open to Everyone, Friends and Family, and Solo.

The  distributed-denial-of-service  (DDOS) attack targeted a secure national data network, affecting a range of private and public institutions.  Sofie Nystrøm, NSM’s Director General, claimed that a pro-Russian hacker group seems to be behind the attack. It currently looks like no significant damage was done, with “no sensitive information taken.”     Among the affected websites was the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority’s website, which was down on Wednesday due to the attack. Other organizations that fell victim to the attack were not named.   “We have seen similar attacks in other countries recently, but none of these have reported lasting consequences. The attacks will still be able to create uncertainty in the population, and give the impression that we are a piece in the current political situation in Europe,” Nystrøm said in a statement.   Earlier in May, NSM requested Norwegian companies to prepare for DDOS attacks.  Russia has previously threatened Norway with “retaliatory measures” for blocking access to the Svalbard archipelago.  “We indicated that unfriendly actions against Russia will inevitably lead to appropriate retaliatory measures,” the Russian foreign ministry said.

It tasked three companies to develop design concepts that could see a lunar nuclear power system up and running by the end of the decade.   It will need to provide at least 40Kw of power, enough to run 30 households for 10 years continuously. NASA says the demonstration will pave the way for long-duration missions on the Moon and Mars.   “New technology drives our exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said. “Developing these early designs will help us lay the groundwork for powering our long-term human presence on other worlds.”    Three 12-month contracts, each valued at approximately $5m, were awarded through the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory. Lockheed Martin, Westinghouse, and IX won the contracts. Each will partner with other companies.           “The Fission Surface Power project is a very achievable first step toward the United States establishing nuclear power on the Moon,” Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said. “I look forward to seeing what each of these teams will accomplish.”  The technology would be used for future space exploration under the Artemis umbrella.

{"title": "Germany probes Apple's tracking rules", "published_date": "14 June 2022 ", "description": "Apple's rules apply to third parties but not to Apple itself, Germany's antitrust watchdog said after initiating proceedings against the technology giant.  The Bundeskartellamt is looking into Apple's App Tracking Transparency Framework (ATT) for third-party apps to see whether these rules leave other companies at a disadvantage.    \"A corporation like Apple, which is in a position to unilaterally set rules for its ecosystem, in particular for its app store, should make pro-competitive rules. We have reason to doubt that this is the case when we see that Apple's rules apply to third parties, but not to Apple itself,\" Andreas Mundt, President of the Bundeskartellamt, said.  Not abiding by its own rules would allow Apple \"to give preference to its own offers or impede other companies.\"  Apple's ATT framework requires users to give additional consent through third-party apps. Tracking can be used by advertisers and app developers, for example, to display targeted advertising.          \"These options can be particularly relevant to providers of third-party apps in case their business models rely on apps which are available free of charge but financed through advertising,\" the German watchdog noted.  Its preliminary findings indicate that Apple is not subject to the new and additional rules of the App Tracking Transparency Framework.  Last week, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the UK  said  it wanted to investigate Apple and Google's market power in mobile browsers and Apple's restrictions on cloud gaming through its App Store.  \"When it comes to how people use mobile phones, Apple and Google hold all the cards.

{"title": "Atlassian zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild", "published_date": "07 June 2022 ", "description": "The exploit of a critical vulnerability in Confluence Server and Data Center allowed malicious actors to gain full remote access on unpatched servers.  The critical vulnerability (CVE-2022-26134) in Atlassian products was first announced by researchers at cybersecurity firm Volexity. Atlassian is an Australian software giant providing products for developers and managers.  The company has  released  an advisory on mitigation of the vulnerability. At the same time, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability to its catalog,  requiring  US federal institutions to block internet traffic to Confluence servers on their networks.    “We strongly recommend upgrading to a fixed version of Confluence as there are several other security fixes included in the fixed versions of Confluence,” reads Atlassian’s advisory.          Researchers at Volexity noted something fishy after detecting JSP webshells being written on disk on two internet-facing web servers of their clients.  “After a thorough review of the collected data, Volexity was able to determine the server compromise stemmed from an attacker launching an exploit to achieve remote code execution,” researchers wrote.  The vulnerability allowed attackers to gain unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on the servers. RCEs are particularly dangerous as they allow threat actors to gain full control of a vulnerable system without credentials.  According to the researchers, once in the Confluence Server system, attackers would deploy an in-memory copy of the BEHINDER implant that allows performing RCE attacks without additionally writing files to disk.  With the BEHINDER in place, attackers used it to deploy the CHINA CHOPPER web shell and simple file upload tool as backups to maintain access to the hacked server.  After analyzing attacker network traffic and legitimate IP addresses, researchers were led to believe that multiple threat actors from China were actively exploiting the vulnerability.    “By exploiting this kind of vulnerability, attackers can gain direct access to highly sensitive systems and networks. Further, these systems can often be difficult to investigate, as they lack the appropriate monitoring or logging capabilities,” researchers wrote.

Instead of a ransom demand, its operators force victims to provide financial assistance to those in need.  “Goodwill ransomware group propagates very unusual demands in exchange for the decryption key. The Robin Hood-like group is forcing its Victims to donate to the poor and provides financial assistance to the patients in need,” cybersecurity company CloudSEK  said  after analyzing the GoodWill ransomware.    Researchers first identified the malware in March 2022. Once the device is infected with the ransomware, it encrypts important files, including documents, databases, and photos, and renders them inaccessible without the decryption key.   Instead of a ransom demand, the GoodWill operators ask their victims to perform three socially-driven activities, record them, and post the good deed on social media.   Activity 1: Donate new clothes to the homeless.  Activity 2: Take five less fortunate children to Dominos, Pizza Hut, or KFC for a treat.  Activity 3: Provide financial assistance to anyone who needs urgent medical attention but cannot afford it.   Along with the photo, video, or audio files documenting the activity, victims are also asked to write a note on social media on “how you transformed yourself into a kind human being by becoming a victim of a ransomware called GoodWill.”  “Upon completing all three activities, the ransomware operators verify the media files shared by the victim and their posts on social media. The actor will then share the complete decryption kit, which includes the main decryption tool, password file, and a video tutorial on how to recover all important files,” CloudSEK said.  The company’s researchers traced the email address provided by the gang to an Indian-based IT services provider.  CloudSEK found some 1246 strings of this ransomware, out of which 91 strings overlap with the HiddenTear, open-source ransomware developed by a Turkish programmer.  “CloudSEK researchers found the following strings of the malware interesting: “error hai bhaiya”: This string is written in Hinglish, which means “there is an error, brother.” This indicates that the operators are from India and that they speak Hindi,” researchers said.

Last year, Meta (Facebook’s parent company,) opened up access to targeting information for more than 1.65 million social issue, electoral, and political ads leading up to the 2020 US election.  Data is now available for ads run globally since August 2020.  Coming in July, Meta’s publicly available Ad Library will also include a summary of targeting information for ads run after launch.   “This update will include data on the total number of social issue, electoral and political ads a Page ran using each type of targeting (such as location, demographics and interests) and the percentage of social issue, electoral and political ad spend used to target those options,” Meta said.  It also included details on whether a Page used Custom Audiences and/or lookalike audiences.  “For example, the Ad Library could show that over the last 30 days, a Page ran 2,000 ads about social issues, elections or politics, and that 40% of their spend on these ads was targeted to “people who live in Pennsylvania” or “people who are interested in politics.” Meta said.

{"title": "Cyber kingpins “earn” up to $600,000 a month", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "From cryptocurrencies to the metaverse, cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to drain victims’ wallets. Rookie fraudsters start with $20,000 while master criminals “earn” up to $600,000 a month.  Fraud “employment” outpaces cybersecurity jobs, claims fraud deterrence firm Arkose Labs. Criminals are increasingly targeting fintech, gaming, technology, and e-commerce companies, assuming these industries have the biggest coffins to steal from.  The global cybersecurity industry  employs  almost 4,2 million people and has another 2.7 million vacant positions.     Arkose Labs New Intelligence Report estimates that there are at least 15 million fraudsters at large, jumping on any possible opportunity to lure victims into a trap.  Based on behavioral data, Arkose Labs defined two primary categories of fraudsters. Rookies, buying bots as a service to execute attacks at scale and make money fast, make up to $20,000 a month. Master fraudsters devise complex, multi-pronged attack strategies, using multiple tools scripted together alongside fraud farm workers, and are willing to invest in resources and development to bypass defenses continually. They “earn” up to $600,000 a month.  Network defenders are nowhere near getting that high of a salary. According to the 2021 (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Survey of 4,753 cybersecurity professionals, the average salary before taxes in 2021 was over $90,000.In North America, the average salary is $119,000 before taxes, Latin America – $32,000, Europe – $78,000, and APAC – $61,000.  According to Arkose Labs Chief Criminal Officer Brett Johnson, the number of active fraudsters has increased tenfold since 2019, primarily because of the “easy money” that could be made from unemployment stimulus programs during the pandemic. The vast network of cybercriminals on social media and the abundance of fraud tutorials makes it easy for rookies to jump-start their “careers.”  “Rookie Fraudsters move into the Master Fraudster category due to the vast information sharing of attack techniques on the dark web. Marketplace and messaging platforms have become popularized in the fraud community, where cybercriminals can promote their fraud business, recommend attack tools and techniques, and offer free step-by-step guides for the rookie fraudster. With this widespread information sharing, human fraudsters are capable of using bot tools to attack at scale, and Rookie fraudsters uplevel their attack skills much faster,” Johnson said.

{"title": "Misconfiguration leaves ‘firewalled’ Google Cloud exposed - report", "published_date": "05 May 2022 ", "description": "A dangerous functionality could allow adversaries to remotely access a network deemed secure from outside intruders.  Likely a common misconfiguration of Google Cloud systems could leave the network exposed to capable adversaries, researchers at Mitiga, a Cloud Incident Response Company,  claim .  “We at Mitiga believe that this misconfiguration is likely common enough to warrant concern; however, with proper access control to the GCP environment there is no exploitable flaw,” Andrew Johnston, Principal Consultant at Mitiga, writes.    Researchers discovered an application programming interface (API) method (getSerialPortOutput) that enables users to retrieve output from serial ports. Researchers claim that in Linux systems, ‘ports’ are files of a specific form.  “This API represented an interesting opportunity: the cloud control plane would allow us to read data from these serial ports, but from the VM’s perspective, writing to a serial port was a local action in that it did not require connectivity to a foreign system,” Johnston claims.          According to the report, researchers successfully created a firewall-protected virtual machine (VM) within the Google Cloud Platform and were able to read data from its serial ports via the cloud control plane.  The cloud control plane is part of a network that carries information necessary to establish and control the network.  Interestingly, the communication between VM and control plane would not be entirely visible to an administrator as the traffic is classified ‘GOOGLE_INTERNAL.’  “By itself, this API represents not much more than a stealthy method of exfiltration. While interesting, it would be much more powerful if we could identify a companion API method that would enable an adversary to send data to the machine,” Johnston wrote.  One of these ‘companion methods’ calls back to Google Cloud’s feature that enabled users with appropriate permissions to modify machine metadata at runtime. Paired with getSerialPortOutput, it could allow for a full feedback loop and develop C2 capabilities.    Researchers found that they could write a script that enabled them to control the VM remotely using the two API methods.  “Since any script included in user data is run as root, we further can leverage this method to ensure our malware has full administrative access to the system,” Johnston explained.  While exploiting Google Cloud’s functionalities requires relevant permissions to the targeted systems, getSerialPortOutput is often available to low-permission ‘viewer’ roles.  “This is concerning given that getSerialPortOutput enables exfiltration regardless of how firewalls are configured. An adversary could potentially use this method to stealthily exfiltrate from a system which the adversary gained access to via a traditional method,” reads the blog post.    Image by Shutterstock.   Mitiga came to an agreement with Google that their findings do not represent a ‘vulnerability’ in a technical sense but a potentially problematic permissions model within the Google Cloud Platform.  Somewhat similar malign feature was discovered to  plague Micrisoft’s Azure  last November. According to researchers, once new employees join an organization, they might be added to a 'group permission' within the Azure active directory tenancy.  On its own merit, that's nothing to be concerned with and benefits the organization since group permission can be role-specific.  However, if threat actors took over an account that has the permission to change a specific group's owners or add group members, they could exploit the group permission feature to on-prem domain compromise.  Several permissions could allow a threat actors to gain access to all OneDrive directories that belong to an organization. Overly generous access permission could even lead to an attacker taking hold of victims' Office365 services.

{"title": "Down but not out: Russian crooks rally to new strongholds", "published_date": "27 April 2022 ", "description": "Cybercriminals affiliated with the pariah superstate are setting up shop on other platforms after the recent shutdown of major illicit trading forums used by threat actors, analysis by Digital Shadows confirms.  Ever resilient in the face of adversity, Russian gangs are bouncing back from the high-profile dissolution of  HYDRA  and  RaidForums , taken down earlier this month by authorities in Germany and the US respectively.     “With HYDRA out of the picture, cybersecurity researchers have observed [cybercriminal] vendors relocating their activities exclusively to Telegram,” said Digital Shadows. “In addition, the established, Russian-language marketplace MEGA has a strong chance of emerging as the go-to marketplace for former HYDRA users because it also serves a diverse demand for illegal items.”  Like its predecessor, MEGA purveys a multitude of sins, including databases of harvested credentials, carding and counterfeit-related products, and off-the-shelf hacking software. Since last year, its user base increased by around 1,700, a figure Digital Shadows forecasts will continue growing in the wake of HYDRA’s demise.  From one forum to another RaidForums appears to have a strong contender for a successor too, with BreachForums touted for the spot by a former member last month.  “Although still very much in its early stages, BreachForums has the potential to become a proper replacement for RaidForums,” said Digital Shadows, adding that at the time of writing, the site had more than 5,000 members and counting.   In further evidence of migration between platforms, some of the new usernames on BreachForums are identical to those used on Russian-language cybercriminal forums.  But with more than half a million users registered on RaidForums before its shutdown, the new platform has some way to go before it can emerge as the true successor.  “BreachForums has nowhere near the user base and popularity of RaidForums, but it has some advantages that could enable it to grow,” said Digital Shadows. These entail providing incentives to former RaidForums users, similar functionality and appearance to its predecessor, and having a reputable former RaidForums user as its administrator.    Yet more to come While RaidForums was noted for being an English-language platform that also attracted users from Russia, Digital Shadows warns that black-hat hackers from the Federation are also likely to turn to forums that only use their native language.  “While MEGA, BreachForums, and Telegram appear to be early favorites for adoption by some Russian cybercriminals, well-established Russian-language forums will likely see an influx of some of these displaced individuals,” it said.   Digital Shadows also cautioned that the law’s recent progress against threat actors would not prevent cybercrime from flourishing on these alternative platforms – perhaps like never before, as Russians feeling the effects of Western sanctions double down on their illicit activities.  “We may see increasing numbers of Russia-based cybercriminals compelled to pursue more financially motivated cybercrime in response to the sanctions’ effects on Russia’s economy,” it said.

{"title": "North Korean hackers named behind the $620 million Ronin hack", "published_date": "19 April 2022 ", "description": "Two state-sponsored hacker groups stole over $620 million worth of crypto from the Ronin exchange.  The FBI  attributed  the  March 29 hack  of the Ronin decentralized currency exchange to Lazarus Group and APT 38. Both groups are associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  \"Through our investigation, we were able to confirm Lazarus Group and APT38, cyber actors associated with the DPRK, are responsible for the theft of $620 million in Ethereum reported on March 29,\" reads the FBI's statement.    According to Ronin, the attackers used hacked private keys to forge fake withdrawals. The Ronin decentralized currency exchange was halted after the breach was discovered, leaving users unable to conduct transactions until further notice.          North Korea employs cybercrime to finance its dictatorship, which runs a country mostly closed off from the outside world.  While  APT38, also known as 'Un-usual Suspects,'  is almost certainly a state-sponsored actor, its primary goals are financial. Hacker groups operated by state intelligent services often focus more on intelligence.  According  to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, North Korea launched at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400 million worth of digital assets last year.  A United Nations panel of experts that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programs to circumvent sanctions.  Last year the United States charged three North Korean computer programmers working for the country's intelligence service with a massive, years-long hacking spree to steal more than $1.3 billion in money and cryptocurrency, affecting companies from banks to Hollywood movie studios.  Reports by cybersecurity firm Mandiant show that North Korea aims to expand its profitable operation, setting up new hacker groups. The recently formed  Bureau 325  has quickly risen to prominence to become North Korea's \"Swiss army knife\" cybercriminal gang.

{"title": "Crooks exploit Log4Shell to target VMware Horizon servers", "published_date": "15 November 2023 ", "description": "Attackers use the Log4Shell vulnerability to deliver backdoors and profiling scripts to unpatched VMware Horizon servers.  Cybersecurity company Sophos said that multiple adversaries are targeting vulnerable Horizon servers, paving the way for persistent access and future ransomware attacks.  Log4Shell  is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Java logging component, Apache Log4J, embedded in hundreds of software products. The vulnerability was discovered and patched last December.  Amit Yoran, CEO of cybersecurity company Tenable,  said  that the Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution Vulnerability is the last decade's single most significant, critical vulnerability.    \"The discovery of this vulnerability is nothing short of a Fukushima moment for the cybersecurity industry.\"  According to a senior security researcher at Sophos, Sean Gallagher, Sophos detections  reveal  waves of attacks targeting Horizon servers, starting in January, and delivering a range of backdoors and cryptominers to unpatched servers as scripts to collect some device information.    Widely used applications such as VMware Horizon exposed to the internet and need to be manually updated are particularly vulnerable to exploitation at scale. [...] Log4J is installed in hundreds of software products. Many organizations may be unaware of the vulnerability lurking within their infrastructure, particularly in commercial, open-source, or custom software that doesn't have regular security support,   Sean Gallagher.   Sophos believes that some of the backdoors may be delivered by Initial Access Brokers looking to secure persistent remote access to a high-value target that they can sell to other attackers, such as ransomware operators.  Sophos detected multiple attack payloads using Log4Shell to target vulnerable Horizon servers:  * Two legitimate remote monitoring and management tools, Atera agent and Splashtop Streamer, likely intended for malicious use as backdoors  * The malicious Sliver backdoor  * The cryptominers z0Miner, JavaX miner, Jin and Mimu    * Several PowerShell-based reverse shells that collect device and backup information  According to Sophos, the largest wave of attacks that began in mid-January 2022 executed the cryptominer installer script directly from the Apache Tomcat component of the VMware Horizon server. This wave of attacks is ongoing.  \"Sophos' findings suggest that multiple adversaries are implementing these attacks, so the most important protective step is to upgrade all devices and applications, including Log4J, with the  patched version  of the software. This includes  patched versions  of VMWare Horizon if organizations use the application in their network,\" said Gallagher.   Patching is not enough as attackers might have already installed a web shell or backdoor in the network.   \"Defense in depth and acting upon any detection of miners and other anomalous activity is critical to avoid falling victim to such attacks.\"   More from Cybernews: Privacy in the metaverse: dead on arrival?

{"title": "Beware: Facebook’s login alert used to scam users", "published_date": "27 January 2023 ", "description": "Malicious actors hide behind even the most mundane of alerts.  Everyone who’s ever tried logging in to Facebook from a new device is familiar with the “someone tried to log into your account” email.  According to a  blog post  by Christopher Boyd, lead malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes, scammers try to leverage the familiar message to their benefit.    Bogus Facebook phishing messages are making their way to users’ inboxes. As with many other phishing scams, threat actors bank on the victim’s sense of urgency in an event of an unknown sign-in attempt.  Boyd claims that the novel scam is dangerous because the message impersonating Facebook is made to look credible enough to fool anyone.          The email combines a minimal design with a clear message: “A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it’s really you.”  The email presents users with two clickable buttons. One says, ‘report the user,’ while the second one displays the ‘yes, me’ option.  Interestingly enough, clicking on the ‘options’ does not lead a victim to a phishing site. Instead, it popped open a pre-formatted mail in your client of choice for you to respond to the creators.  „Anybody replying would likely receive additional requests for login details or much more besides,“ Boyd writes.  Once victims click on one of the two options, they‘re prompted with a pre-filled response form with an email subject line saying, ‘send statement.’    According to Boyd, the victims likely receive an infected document meant to further phish for credentials. An attempt to infect the system with malware cannot be ruled out.  To avoid falling victim to a similar scam, security researchers advise to always navigate directly to the sender of supposed security alerts. The service provider will always be able to assist with a real issue.  It’s also advised not to hurry with a response as scammers always try to abuse vulnerabilities coming from rushed decisions.
